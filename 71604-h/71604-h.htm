<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> five boys belonging to the “Rambler
Club,” together with Cranny Beaumont and
his father’s ward, Willie Sloan, have made a
trip to Wyoming.</p>

<p>They find that since their last visit to
Border City the town has undergone a great
change, and is still in the midst of a true
Western boom. To add to the interest, a New
York financier is carrying on experiments
with a dirigible balloon.</p>

<p>At Circle T Ranch the lads meet some of
their old friends among the cowboys.</p>

<p>This story tells how the Ramblers came
into possession of an aeroplane. Willie Sloan
is an odd little chap, rather difficult to understand,
and is not altogether pleased with life
on the plains. His presence among the crowd
is largely responsible for their unexpected and
startling adventures, in several of which the
Border City aeronaut and his dirigible balloon
figure prominently. As an aviator, Bob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Somers finds that all his coolness and skill are
needed.</p>

<p>The stay in Wyoming brings about quite an
unexpected result for Willie Sloan.</p>

<p>Other experiences of the same boys are told
in “The Rambler Club Afloat,” “The Rambler
Club’s Winter Camp,” “The Rambler Club
in the Mountains,” “The Rambler Club on
Circle T Ranch,” “The Rambler Club Among
the Lumberjacks,” “The Rambler Club’s Gold
Mine,” “The Rambler Club’s House-boat.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>A LETTER FROM BOB</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I tell</span> you, Cranny, it’s simply impossible
to do anything with that boy; he hasn’t a bit
of energy. Whenever my back is turned,
he’s idling away his time. I do wish to goodness
I could wash my hands of him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton Beaumont, real estate agent of
Tacoma, Washington, paced the floor of the
office, his round, good-natured face wearing a
most gloomy and disturbed expression. Mr.
Beaumont was a large man—large in all
dimensions—height, breadth and rotundity.
The light, too, which, in spite of his present
displeasure, shone from a pair of keen gray
eyes, indicated a kindly, sympathetic disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Cranston Beaumont, generally known as
Cranny, bore but little resemblance to his
father. Cranny was long of limb, wide of
shoulder, his loose frame suggesting great
strength and agility. The lurking smile at
the corners of a generous mouth appeared to
be somewhat offset by the aggressive appearance
of a prominent chin; but, altogether,
Cranny was a wholesome, clean-cut chap, full
of life, and brimming over with courage.</p>

<p>Cranny’s expression gave no indication that
his father’s words struck a responsive chord;
instead, he seemed to be in the happiest frame
of mind, his eyes occasionally turning toward
a letter which lay open on a desk before him.</p>

<p>“I believe that Willie is positively hopeless,”
went on Mr. Beaumont, in a louder
tone. “But it doesn’t appear to bother you
in the least. Whom is that letter from? It
seems to interest you hugely.”</p>

<p>Cranny sank against the back of his chair
and began to whistle softly, while the joyful
look on his face deepened. Mr. Beaumont’s
thoughts, however, were too full of another
subject to pursue his inquiries further.</p>

<p>“I often wonder if that boy has a spark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of ambition in his whole make-up,” he continued.
“He’s careless to an exasperating degree.
Cranny, have you noticed my desk?”</p>

<p>His son rose to his feet and walked across
to the opposite side of the office, where he
stopped to gaze at several long irregular black
smears on the otherwise clean top of Mr.
Beaumont’s desk.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! now isn’t that a peach of a
decoration,” he gurgled. “Ha, ha! How in
the world——”</p>

<p>“Cranny, I must again ask you not to use
those slang expressions,” broke in his father,
reproachfully; “do try to cultivate more
elegance of speech.”</p>

<p>“Say, dad, when did the ink foundry get
this boost?”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont sighed.</p>

<p>“Early this morning I asked Willie to copy
some papers, and the result was disastrous.
He upset the ink bottle, nearly ruining an
important legal paper, smeared his face and
hands, and—and—well, Cranny, I’m totally
disgusted—that’s all.”</p>

<p>Cranny burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Honest to goodness, I can’t help it, dad,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
he chuckled. “What did Willie say about
this inky affair?”</p>

<p>“The same old thing—‘I couldn’t help it’—his
usual explanation for whatever happens
through his own carelessness.”</p>

<p>“Sorry now you promised his father to look
out for him, eh?”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont eyed his son for a moment
without speaking, then seated himself before
his desk, to begin fidgeting with some papers
in a pigeonhole.</p>

<p>“I never had a better friend than Bob
Sloan, Cranny,” he said, slowly; “he was
one of those unfortunate men, who, though
intelligent, seem to have, for some reason, a
hard time to make their way in the world, so
he left this poor lad practically without a
penny. Could I have done otherwise than
agree to act as his guardian?—Of course not!
But, Cranny”—Mr. Beaumont’s voice relapsed
into its former querulous tone—“it’s
the lad’s future that worries me. What is to
become of him? He doesn’t seem interested
in anything or anybody, has no thought of
the value of time—he’s almost sixteen now,
and should begin to realize that those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
fritter away their youth generally live to regret
such folly.”</p>

<p>“I’ve eaten fritters an’ lived to regret my
folly,” murmured Cranny, sotto voce.</p>

<p>“And no amount of good advice seems to
have any effect on him whatever,” went on
Mr. Beaumont, despondently.</p>

<p>“Willie has a bad case o’lazyitis, dad—that’s
what’s the matter,” remarked Cranny.
“I’ve watched the little duffer——”</p>

<p>“Cranny—Cranny,” protested his father,
“you know that is just the sort of language
I object to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I’ll cut it all out, sir, though it
comes hard,” grinned Cranny. “But, honest,
dad, when you weren’t here, I’ve seen him
holding down that chair for an hour without
doing a lick of work. Oh, he’s a pippin, all
right! But say, dad, let’s give wee Willie the
go-by for half a minute—you asked me about
this letter. Whom do you think it’s from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel in any mood for guessing,
Cranny.”</p>

<p>“Well, to relieve your great anxiety, I’ll
tell you in two words—Bob Somers.”</p>

<p>“Bob Somers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Sure thing! Bob Somers and the Ramblers
are heading this way. Oh, never mind
about the slang, dad; I forgot. My, but I’ll
never forget the bully time we had at Circle
T Ranch.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll never forget how you kept on
talking about it, either,” said Mr. Beaumont,
dryly. “But Bob Somers is a lad that any
father ought to be proud of—manly and self-reliant;
not a bit of laziness in his composition,
Cranny.”</p>

<p>“I should say not; he’s a hummer, all
right; an’ there’s good old Dave Brandon,
and little Tommy Clifton, and—and——”</p>

<p>“I think we lived in Kingswood long
enough to know Sam Randall and Dick Travers,”
interrupted his father, his round face relapsing
into a broad smile. “Both good,
lively chaps, too.”</p>

<p>“And Dave! Isn’t he a winner, dad?”</p>

<p>“A winner!” echoed Mr. Beaumont, in a
puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“Sure! one of those chaps who is wise to
all the good things going on. Why——”</p>

<p>“Cranny—Cranny—what extraordinary
language you do use.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Oh, never mind, dad. Talk about me!
Why, you ought to have heard some of the
cow-punchers warble at Circle T Ranch.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was talking about Dave Brandon.
That chap can write and paint to beat the
Dutch; and he knows all those queer little
marks you dab into writing—commas and
demi-commas.”</p>

<p>“Why, Cranny!”</p>

<p>The tall lad chuckled softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that isn’t just the right name,”
he laughed. “I’ve seen him paint some
dandy pictures; one of ’em had more’n fifteen
colors in it—honest, I counted.”</p>

<p>“Dave is certainly a bright lad,” said Mr.
Beaumont. “But you haven’t yet told me
what Bob Somers has written you.”</p>

<p>Cranny plumped himself down into the
nearest chair and waved the letter aloft,
while his eyes began to sparkle with excitement.</p>

<p>“Well, you heard about that great mine
they found, eh, dad?”</p>

<p>“The Rambler Club’s Gold Mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes; exactly! Well, after doing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
stunt, they all brake-beamed-it back to Kingswood,
and——”</p>

<p>“Brake-beamed-it! Why, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just a little of the language you
object to, dad,” laughed Cranny. “Brake-beamers
are chaps who stow themselves away
under freight-cars when the trainmen aren’t
looking. But the Ramblers were able to dig
down in their jeans for the coin.”</p>

<p>“The purity of the English language will
eventually be destroyed if the coming generation
keeps up this dreadful slang,” murmured
Mr. Beaumont. Then, aloud, he
added: “And where is Bob Somers now?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was coming to, dad. He
and the other boys spent the winter at school
in Kingswood, while a couple of mining engineers
hiked out to Washington to see the
mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know all about that, Cranny,” interrupted
Mr. Beaumont. “When the news
was received it started a gold rush to that
section. Many men staked out claims, and
the mining recorder and gold commissioner
were kept pretty busy for a while. The parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
of the Ramblers formed a company to
operate the mine.”</p>

<p>“And Bob Somers writes that a regular
little town has sprung up out there,” added
Cranny, “and that some one has even opened
a general store.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say Bob has traveled all
that distance again?” queried Mr. Beaumont.</p>

<p>“Well, I should smile. The whole crowd,
too. Just as soon as school was over they
chucked their books to the scrap heap and
beat it out to the mine.”</p>

<p>“Cranny, how many times must I entreat
you not to use such language?”</p>

<p>“Honest, dad, I keep on forgetting. But
my, hasn’t that Rambler Club been going
some? They’re in Portland now, and headin’
right this way. Hooray—listen!” Cranny
held Bob’s letter up to the light. “‘We expect
to reach Tacoma in a few days,’” he
read, “‘and, of course, we’ll hunt you up.
And I can promise that there’ll be lots to talk
about. And, Cranny, our crowd has decided
to visit Circle T Ranch again. What do you
think of that?’</p>

<p>“What do I think of that?” repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Cranny, in a loud tone, as he brought the
palm of his right hand down on his knee with
a resounding slap. “Why, I think it’s the
bulliest scheme out. Dad, you’ll have to give
me a couple o’ weeks’ vacation—honest to
goodness you must. I couldn’t stand not
going along. Why, say, did I ever tell you
about——”</p>

<p>“If you have missed the smallest detail of
your momentous visit to the cattle country it
would surprise me greatly,” said Mr. Beaumont.
“I expected something like this just
as soon as you mentioned Bob Somers’ name.
Still”—the frown departed from his face—“I
don’t know that I can blame you; but,
Cranny, your services can’t be spared just
now. If——”</p>

<p>His sentence was interrupted by the sudden
opening of the door, which admitted to the
room, first, a shaft of light from the corridor,
and, second, a slight boyish form.</p>

<p>“Ah, Willie; here you are,” said Mr.
Beaumont.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>WILLIE CANNOT HELP IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Willie Sloan</span>, age fifteen and a half, quite
small for his years, wasn’t a bad-looking
chap; or, rather, wouldn’t have been if his
expression had indicated a greater degree
of satisfaction with the world. Discontent
seemed written all over his youthful face, and
even his slouchy gait and untidy appearance
told of an unhappy spirit. A mass of tousled
hair, of a chestnut color, fell over a moderately
high forehead; deep brown eyes, which
had a habit of staring straight at one in a
rather disconcerting fashion—some called it
impudent—a thin nose, and a mouth never
quite still completed his facial make-up.</p>

<p>But the light of boyish enthusiasm was
woefully lacking in Willie Sloan’s face; and
his voice, too, when he presently spoke, did
not ring with the spirit of youth.</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Beaumont, I lost that letter
you told me to leave for Mr. Sharswood,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
began, in a dogged manner, staring hard into
Cranny’s grinning face.</p>

<p>“Lost it, Willie! Why, how in the world
did that happen?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, sir. I must have
dropped the envelope when I pulled some
papers out o’ my pocket, just before getting
there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont shot a swift, expressive
glance at his son, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Willie, that may put me to no end of
trouble.” His tone was as stern as his good-natured
disposition would permit him to
assume. “I’m more and more astonished at
your carelessness.”</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry, sir; I couldn’t help it,”
persisted Willie, as he threw his cap sullenly
on a chair.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t help it!” sneered Cranny. “My
land, but you do make me tired.”</p>

<p>“Then go take a rest,” said Willie, staring
at him still harder. “Never lost anything
yourself, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” interrupted Mr. Beaumont.
“Don’t have any words about it,
boys. Cranny, call up Mr. Sharswood; I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
have to explain this matter to him at once;
and, Willie, you may keep on writing those
letters I dictated this morning.”</p>

<p>The small lad, with a defiant look toward
Cranny, seated himself before a typewriter
which stood near Mr. Beaumont’s desk, and,
in a half-hearted manner, began to pound the
keys.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, Mr. Sharswood,” Mr.
Beaumont was presently saying over the
’phone. “How did it happen? Well,
Willie lost it—that’s all. Too bad you feel
that way about it. Yes, I’ll be in the office
all afternoon. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Is he comin’ over, dad?” asked Cranny,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Yes. Mr. Sharswood seems to be very
much annoyed indeed,” answered his father.
“The paper contained an opinion from my
lawyer concerning an important transfer of
property over which he has had some litigation.
I shouldn’t have entrusted Willie with
it,” he added, in a tone so low that it did not
reach the lad’s ears. “He is becoming worse
and worse.”</p>

<p>“Old Sharswood’ll call him down good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
an’ hard; he’s a slam-back chap,” chirped
Cranny.</p>

<p>“Please do not use such disrespectful terms,
my son,” remonstrated the other. “What’s
that—am I going to give you a vacation?—I’m
afraid not.”</p>

<p>“Why?” grumbled Cranny. “I don’t
want to be cooped up in this office all
summer like a chicken in a wicker-work
basket. Come, dad!”</p>

<p>“I can’t talk about it now, Cranny.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont turned away, while his son,
with a look of extreme disgust, tossed Bob
Somers’ letter into an open drawer of his desk.</p>

<p>Cranny ran a close second to Willie Sloan
in his lack of attention to business that afternoon.
He found it almost impossible to keep
his mind on the dry details of office work,
for entrancing pictures of Circle T Ranch and
the cow-punchers would persist in passing before
his mental vision.</p>

<p>“Think of the great sport that bunch is
going to have,” he murmured. “Gee! It’s
enough to make a chap——”</p>

<p>A quick step in the corridor, the rattle of
the knob as the door flew open, and the appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of a stout, florid-faced man brought
his wandering thoughts back with startling
abruptness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sharswood!” said Mr. Beaumont,
rising from his desk.</p>

<p>“Yes; here I am!” exclaimed the other,
gruffly. “See here, Beaumont, how about
that paper?”</p>

<p>Willie Sloan’s brown eyes were staring
straight at Mr. Sharswood, while a scowl on
his forehead slowly deepened.</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say, Beaumont, that
you actually gave an important paper like
that into the care of an irresponsible lad?”
demanded Mr. Horatio Sharswood, as he vigorously
mopped his face. “Why, it’s simply
ridiculous—almost reprehensible. See here,
boy, what do you mean by such a piece of
stupid carelessness?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t careless. I couldn’t help it,”
mumbled Willie.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t help it! Fiddlesticks! And
don’t you stare at me like that, either. It’s a
mighty good thing you’re not in my office;
I’d bundle you out in short order.”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to leave it,” snapped Willie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Mr. Horatio Sharswood’s florid face turned
a shade redder.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of such impudence?”
he stormed. “Beaumont, do you allow your
clients to be spoken to in that manner by a
little whiffet of an office boy? Does he express
any regret for his action?—oh, no—just
brazens it out. Why—why——”</p>

<p>“I’m not a whiffet!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sharswood stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“Never lost anything yourself, I s’pose?”
piped Willie.</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” commanded Mr. Beaumont,
sternly. “Mr. Sharswood,” he added, “this
is my ward, Willie Sloan. I regret exceedingly
the loss of the paper, and will do all in
my power to——”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee—oh, my! If that ain’t the queerest
yet!”</p>

<p>This exclamation, in Willie Sloan’s squeaky
voice, interrupted him. The boy was clutching
an envelope which he had just drawn from
some deep recess of a capacious pocket, and
stood staring at it with a comical look of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Oh—ginger—I—I didn’t lose it, after all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Well, wouldn’t that stagger a mule? I—I——”</p>

<p>Cranny clapped his hands together and
burst into a roar of laughter, while the two
gentlemen gazed at the diminutive form of
Mr. Beaumont’s ward in astonishment.</p>

<p>“And do you actually mean to say that
you’ve put me to all this trouble for nothing?”
roared Mr. Sharswood.</p>

<p>“Why—why, you ought to be mighty glad
to get it back, sir,” said Willie, reproachfully.
“I couldn’t help thinking I lost it—felt sure
I’d looked through that pocket carefully;
honest, I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, Beaumont, this is about the
limit!” cried the visitor, as he seized the
envelope from Willie’s outstretched hand.
“All the afternoon wasted—for it put me into
such a state of mind that I couldn’t do a
stroke of work. What do you think of yourself,
young man?”</p>

<p>Willie’s eyes were still staring hard into
the stout man’s face. He gulped once or
twice, then mumbled:</p>

<p>“I’m not wasting any time thinking about
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Don’t feel a bit sorry, eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t mean to do it. You
see——”</p>

<p>Mr. Sharswood waved his hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to speak harshly of your
ward, Beaumont,” he said, “but, really, I fear
you are too easy with him. Keep a tight rein
on the lad. And, as a special favor, my dear
sir, send some one else to my office whenever
important papers have to be delivered.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not asking to come, am I?”
growled Willie, in a sepulchral whisper.</p>

<p>Mr. Horatio Sharswood glared sternly at the
office boy, while Willie glared back.</p>

<p>“What a cheeky little lad!” exclaimed Mr.
Sharswood, breaking an awkward silence.
“He sits there just as calm as you please, staring
a man out of countenance. It’s extraordinary.
No, I can’t stay another instant—not
even the tenth of a second. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The door opened with a jerk, Mr. Horatio
Sharswood’s stout form remained silhouetted
against the clear light outside for scarcely a
moment—then he was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont was too considerate a man
to say very much to his ward before Cranny;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
he didn’t care to hurt the feelings of any one.
Willie would, perhaps, respond to kindness;
but any attempt to drive him might only result
in his becoming more unruly and stubborn.</p>

<p>But a little later, when Cranny had left
the office, Mr. Beaumont talked earnestly to
his ward. Willie listened respectfully, and
promised to do better, even brightening up as
Mr. Beaumont pictured the reward which almost
invariably follows hard and conscientious
work. Then, when the gentleman went
into another room, he worked hard for at
least five minutes.</p>

<p>Cranny and his father’s ward were allowed
to leave the office at an early hour that afternoon,
much to the former’s relief. Cranny
couldn’t get Bob Somers’ letter or the Rambler
Club out of his mind; he pictured to
himself all the good times they were going to
have at Circle T Ranch, and the fate which
he feared was going to keep him tied down to
office work seemed hard indeed.</p>

<p>As the two walked along, he took Bob’s
letter from his pocket and waved it before
Willie’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“See that, kid?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I won’t, if you jab my eyes out with the
corner,” growled his companion.</p>

<p>“Oh, get over that grouch. What’s the
matter with you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Lots.”</p>

<p>“Forget it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. Wouldn’t the way old Sharswood
talked make anybody hopping?”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder he didn’t make you go hopping,
son. Awful nervy—that chirp you got
off, too. He’s a big man in town. I’ll bet
dad was mad.”</p>

<p>“Why? What did I say?” asked Willie,
with an innocent stare.</p>

<p>“Lots! But never mind—it’s all right.
Look here, lad: in a few days, Bob Somers
an’ his crowd’ll strike this town.”</p>

<p>His companion made no reply.</p>

<p>“Did you hear what I said about Bob
Somers an’ his Rambler Club?” Cranny’s
demand was loud and emphatic.</p>

<p>“Sure I did! Do they ramble in their
talk?”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out! The whole bunch is on their
way to Circle T Ranch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Well, there isn’t anything to hinder them
that I know of.”</p>

<p>Cranny glanced at him curiously. He
had frankly confessed to his father that he
couldn’t understand the lad. Willie didn’t
resemble any of the boys he had known.
Jollity and life were certainly missing from
his composition, and without any compensating
qualities of earnestness or ambition.</p>

<p>The big lad thought of these things as
Willie, taking two steps to his one, trudged
by his side up a hilly street. An idea which
seemed to please him immensely entered his
head. The good-natured curve of his lips became
more pronounced.</p>

<p>“Just the thing,” he reflected. “Bully
idea—great! It ought to cinch it. Whoop!”</p>

<p>“Are you talking in your sleep?” demanded
Willie.</p>

<p>“If I did, don’t mind it,” grinned the
other, indulgently.</p>

<p>“As long as you don’t call me a cheeky little
lad, I’ll forgive you. Say, I couldn’t help
thinking I lost that——”</p>

<p>Cranny clapped his hand over Willie’s
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Don’t overwork that ‘couldn’t help it’
idea, boy,” he laughed. “I’ve thought of
something good.”</p>

<p>“A joke on me?” asked Willie, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No; I’ll let you grow some before I play
any more. I won’t tell you what it is.”</p>

<p>“And much I care,” sniffed Willie.</p>

<p>The street rose higher and higher. It was a
neighborhood of attractive residences, many
of which stood on elevations, with roads
winding their way toward them through greenswards
dotted with rich evergreens or flowering
shrubs. Here and there, the two caught
glimpses of a stretch of water, its broad surface
faintly reflecting the varied hues of purple
and golden clouds which lazily floated
above. Commencement Bay is one of the
arms of Puget Sound, the city of Tacoma being
situated at its head. They could see, too,
Mount Tacoma, sixty miles distant, looming
majestically against the sky.</p>

<p>The boys soon turned into a broad path
leading toward a handsome dwelling. The
white columns of its broad portico were entwined
with clinging vines, while potted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
plants stood about, their flowers adding pleasant
touches of color to the surroundings.</p>

<p>“Dad didn’t make any mistake when he
bought this place, eh, Willie?” asked Cranny.</p>

<p>And Willie’s face relaxed sufficiently to
grin a faint acknowledgment.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>CRANNY’S PLAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, what are you going to do about it,
dad?” remarked Cranny, two days later.</p>

<p>Father and son were seated in wicker chairs
on the portico, enjoying a pleasant breeze
which gently rustled the leaves, as it sighed
its way out toward the bay. The distorted
shadow of the house cut across a freshly-mown
lawn; cool, silvery moonlight lay beyond, its
pale rays detaching from obscurity houses
and clumps of trees. Patches of mysterious
gloom stretched here and there, while the
placid bay, far beneath, blended insensibly
outward into the soft, grayish blue of a cloudless
sky.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont pondered a moment before
replying.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Cranny,” he answered.
“Willie is a curious lad. He certainly does
not realize the importance of being in earnest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
I can’t arouse him; nothing I do or say has
the slightest effect.”</p>

<p>“Loafing just as much as ever?” asked
Cranny.</p>

<p>“Whenever I come into the office unexpectedly
I find him either idly drumming
his heels against the chair, or lying back, gazing
listlessly into space.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s a genius,” said Cranny, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“If he is, I haven’t discovered any signs of
it yet.”</p>

<p>“Come, dad, tell me what you are going to
do about it?” repeated Cranny, a curious,
eager expression flitting over his face.</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t know. Willie is more
of a hindrance than a help in the business.
Sharswood is offended—he’s a touchy, excitable
chap. What the boy will do next——”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can tell you what he ought to
do,” interrupted Cranny.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just this.”</p>

<p>Cranny leaned over, and, with a degree of
earnestness unusual to him, spoke in a low
tone, while his father listened in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Well,” queried the lad, as he presently
resumed his former position, “doesn’t that
strike you as a scheme?”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont still made no answer, but
continued to gaze in an abstracted sort of way
at the moonlit distance, while Cranny, eager
and impatient, eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, sir?” his son once more pleaded.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal in what you say,”
admitted Mr. Beaumont. “Association with
a lot of lively, energetic young chaps, such as
Bob Somers and his friends, ought to do a
world of good. But——” He paused.</p>

<p>“But what?” demanded Cranny.</p>

<p>“Circle T Ranch is a long way from here.
I should feel uneasy about him. Life among
the cowboys, and out on the range is full of
danger at times; you know that, son.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d look after him, all right.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. It wouldn’t do to let
him go unless I went, too,” said Cranny,
glibly. “No siree. But think what it
might do for him, dad. Willie needs to be
waked up; he isn’t any use to you now—never
will be if he doesn’t take a mighty big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
brace. And those boys ought to do him more
good in a couple of weeks than everybody else
put together could do in a couple of years.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont’s face was wreathed in a
broad smile.</p>

<p>“Your argument is very ingenious, Cranny;
I see your point—you are entirely willing
to assume all the worries and restrictions of
guardianship for the time being, eh?”</p>

<p>Cranny grinned at the gentle sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Take my advice, sir. I’m not saying that
I don’t want to go to Circle T Ranch the
worst way myself; but you’ve got to do something
about Willie. I’ll bet the little chap
won’t talk the way he does after he’s been out
with those Rambler chaps a few weeks. Now
don’t say no. He’s just about the same size
as Tommy Clifton, and they ought to get
chummy together.”</p>

<p>“Clifton is a good little chap,” said Mr.
Beaumont, reflectively.</p>

<p>“You bet he is. Gets mighty hot, though,
if you say anything about his size,” chuckled
Cranny.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s nice and warm back there in the
moonlight,” came in a piping voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Willie Sloan suddenly appeared from behind
the portico.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” roared Cranny. “Why, you
silly little duffer, the moon doesn’t give out
any heat.”</p>

<p>“Listen to the professor,” jeered Willie,
ambling slowly up the steps. “Like the
mischief it doesn’t. Go back there and feel
it.” He seated himself on the rail. “Isn’t
it a white-hot ball, Mr. Beaumont?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Willie, you’ll be the death of me!”
laughed Cranston.</p>

<p>“The moon is illuminated by the sun’s
rays,” explained Mr. Beaumont, “and astronomers
tell us that it has no atmosphere,
and is so cold that not a vestige of life could
exist upon its surface.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness! Now isn’t that odd?”
murmured Willie, with a peculiar little gasp.
“Isn’t hot, after all, eh? But how do those old
codgers know?—They weren’t ever up there.”</p>

<p>“Willie,” spoke up his guardian, suddenly,
“how would you like to take a vacation?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” demanded Willie, apparently somewhat
startled.</p>

<p>“Cranny expects some of his young friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
here in a few days—they are on their way to
Circle T Ranch, in Wyoming. Do you care
to go along?”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you!” cried Cranny, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe.”</p>

<p>Cranny snorted with disgust.</p>

<p>“Why, you’d have the grandest time you
ever had in your life,” he said, “and——”</p>

<p>“I mightn’t like the crowd,” declared
Willie, calmly. “And say: don’t those
chaps sleep out on the grass; and cook by
moonlight?—I mean by the light of the
moon. And ride bronchos? And shoot
grizzlies? and all that sort of thing? You
told me they did, Cran. Well, that’s not my
style. A nice little room and three square
meals a day is good enough for me.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t care to go?” asked Mr.
Beaumont.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not sure,” answered Willie, indifferently.
“Say, Cranny, did you ever see
a shooting star?”</p>

<p>“No! Nor you, either,” returned Cranny,
highly disgusted.</p>

<p>“Like fun I haven’t. Wouldn’t it be great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
if the moon should shoot? Why do stars
shoot, Mr. Beaumont?”</p>

<p>His guardian smiled.</p>

<p>“What you saw were simply meteors,” he
replied, “and——”</p>

<p>Willie gave another of his peculiar little
gasps.</p>

<p>“Not stars, after all?” he said. “That’s
queer. What are you so mad about,
Cranny?”</p>

<p>But Cranny made no answer. He began
to see his bright dream slowly fade away;
and all on account of Willie’s utter foolishness
and stupidity. He resolved that the little office
boy should be enlightened regarding the
error of his ways, and that immediately.</p>

<p>With his forehead knit into a tremendous
frown, the boy presently rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Want to take a walk, Willie?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Say, did you ever hear of a chap gettin’
moonstruck?” asked Willie. “It’s shining
something awful to-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s more’n you are,” retorted Cranny.
“Coming? Good-bye, dad! We won’t be
long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Once safely outside of hearing distance the
big lad began to talk earnestly. He painted
the most alluring pictures of life at Circle T
Ranch; and poured into Willie’s ears a most
glowing account of the Ramblers and their
exploits.</p>

<p>“And now don’t tell me you’d miss a dandy
chance like this!” he concluded. “Just
think of the time we’ll have! Talk it up
strong, and the pater’ll stand for our going.”</p>

<p>“Say, Cran, you’re awfully good to me!”
said Willie, with suspicious sweetness.
“Thanks! But I don’t know that I’m so
keen on it. That sounds to me like a pretty
rough bunch, anyway.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Cranny, so highly disgusted that
he forgot diplomacy and the gentle art of persuasion,
promptly upset Willie, and, seated on
his wriggling form, tickled his neck with a
blade of grass, at the same time expressing
some very forcible views of his conduct, past
and present.</p>

<p>“And I’ll see that you make a change, all
right,” he announced, as he got up and walked
away.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE RAMBLERS ARRIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">No use</span> coming to the station to meet us,
Cranny,” Bob Somers had written, “for I don’t
really know the exact time we’ll land in Tacoma.
Only this much is certain: it will
be on Thursday.”</p>

<p>And Thursday had arrived.</p>

<p>Cranny worked all day in a fever of impatience.
Every footstep in the corridor set his
heart to thumping; every hand laid upon the
door-knob made him start with eager expectation.</p>

<p>But the day wore on, and still the Ramblers
did not appear.</p>

<p>“I never knew Bob Somers to fail in his
word yet,” grumbled Cranny, at the dinner
table.</p>

<p>“One of those word-as-good-as-his-bond
chaps, I suppose,” grinned Willie, surreptitiously
wiping up with a corner of his napkin
some soup he had spilled. “He must be
a crackerjack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“I do declare, Willie is falling more and
more into the way of using those outlandish
expressions,” sighed Mr. Beaumont to his wife,
a pleasant-looking lady whose hair was just
beginning to show faint traces of gray.</p>

<p>“Willie is young”—she smiled—“and perhaps
Cranston does not always set him a good
example.”</p>

<p>“I can’t talk as if the words came out of a
grammar,” mumbled the big lad, whose eyes
had been continually drifting toward a partly-open
window which commanded a view of the
lawn and roadway.</p>

<p>“I certainly have never heard you do so
yet,” said his father, dryly. “You must remember
that men are judged not only
by——”</p>

<p>“Whoop! By Jupiter, I really believe the
crowd has come at last!” yelled Cranny,
jumping excitedly to his feet. “Whoop!
Hooray! See ’em, dad? One—two—three—four—five—yes;
they are actually coming in.
I’ll bet that’s Bob Somers opening the gate—yes,
I’m sure it is.”</p>

<p>Then Cranny, with another wild “Hooray!”
slammed his chair aside, and would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
dashed toward the door had not a word from
his mother stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait, Cranny,” she pleaded; “don’t act so
like a wild Indian. The boys will be here in
a moment.” She gazed with interest toward
the figures rapidly moving across the field of
view. “My, what a strong, sturdy-looking
lot,” she murmured. “Perhaps, if they would
be willing to let Willie join them——”</p>

<p>The crisp ringing of the electric bell interrupted
her, and Cranny, unable to restrain
himself longer, rushed out of the room. He
nearly knocked down the domestic, who was
hurrying to answer the summons; then threw
open the screen door with a violence that seriously
threatened its hinges.</p>

<p>“Bob Somers and Dave; and—and——”</p>

<p>The hubbub of voices at the door increased
to such proportions that the interested Mr.
and Mrs. Beaumont could only catch an occasional
word. And it lasted for a wonderfully
long time, too.</p>

<p>“Dad—mother—here they are! Come
right in, fellows—no ceremony—mind now.”
Cranny, happy and excited, burst into the
room. “Whoop! Say, Bob, remember that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
time at Circle T Ranch when Spud Ward
told us about the mystery o’ Lone Pine?
This is Willie Sloan, the pater’s ward. Here,
Dave, if you can’t get in the door we’ll have
it widened.”</p>

<p>At last the newcomers crowded in one by
one, shaking hands, hearing pleasant words
of greeting, and responding in kind, until the
babel of voices was only slightly less than before.</p>

<p>The members of the Rambler Club were
certainly a healthy-looking crowd of lads.
Their sun-tanned faces told of outdoor life;
and contact with the world had imparted to
each a sturdy, self-reliant air. Bob Somers,
square-shouldered, with frank blue eyes and
brown hair, seemed to be a fitting leader.
And there was Dave Brandon, the club’s historian
and artist, stouter and more round-faced
than ever. Dick Travers and Sam Randall
seemed never to have been in a happier
mood.</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway, as if rather hesitating
to come forward, was the fifth member—Tommy
Clifton; and it was upon him that
Cranny’s eyes were fixed with strange intensity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Cranny’s face began to wear an expression
of the greatest wonderment. He nudged
Bob sharply in the ribs, exclaiming in a loud
whisper:</p>

<p>“I thought you had brought Tommy Clifton
along?”</p>

<p>“That’s Tom, all right,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“Tom-my—Tom-my?—T-h-a-t isn’t the little
Tommy Clifton I knew,” he gurgled.
“Why—why——”</p>

<p>“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” came a petulant
voice. “There it goes again!”</p>

<p>An extremely tall, attenuated lad, just
lacking a half inch of being six feet, with a
painfully apparent air of self-consciousness,
came slowly up to shake hands with Mr. and
Mrs. Beaumont.</p>

<p>“Say, the ceiling’s just been painted,” observed
Willie Sloan. “Don’t get your hair
in it.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha—ho, ho!” Cranny went off into
another paroxysm of mirth. “That, Tommy
Clifton? Why, honest, I can’t believe it.
Remember what I said the other night, dad,
about his being just the same size as Willie?
Oh, my, oh, my, but isn’t it rich? Tommy, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
that really you?” He walked toward the
tall lad, poked him playfully in the ribs, and
began to laugh again, while Tom, reddening
furiously at being the center of attraction,
tried to draw away.</p>

<p>Dave, who had taken possession of the most
comfortable chair in the room, and was making
himself perfectly at home, kindly came
to his relief.</p>

<p>“Little Cliff started off all at once, like a
sky-rocket,” he explained. “Never saw anything
like the way he sprouted up, eh, Bob?
Could almost see him growing. What! I’m
fatter than ever, you say, Cranny? Oh, how
can you be so cruel?—No. I don’t weigh
three hundred pounds, either.”</p>

<p>“Not yet, you mean,” chuckled Cranny,
taking his eyes reluctantly from Tom’s blushing
face to survey the ample proportions of
the historian and writer. “My goodness, I
shouldn’t want you to fall on me.”</p>

<p>“It’s true that I’m not a featherweight any
more,” sighed Dave. “What’s that, Cranny?—is
my history of the Rambler Club finished
yet? Oh, my, no—only about twelve hundred
pages of it. But, Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
I fear our arrival is most inopportune;
we are delaying your dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just listen to him!” cried Cranny,
gleefully. “If you chaps don’t grub with us
there’ll be the biggest scrap this part of Tacoma
has ever seen.”</p>

<p>The Beaumonts would not listen to any excuses.
There was a vast amount of flurry
and excitement—of everybody getting in
everybody else’s way. The distracted serving
maid saved herself from mental collapse
only by calling in the chauffeur as assistant.
And then the cook, by some extraordinary
process known only to cooks, managed to
provide bountifully for everybody.</p>

<p>The table was pretty well crowded; but no
one cared for that. There was too much to
talk about. As Willie Sloan, with an impish
grin, stared from one Rambler to another,
Cranny judged that he was favorably impressed.</p>

<p>“And so your next stop is at Border City,
in Wyoming?” asked Mr. Beaumont of
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And they say it’s a very different
Border City from the one we knew. Remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
those aviators, Cranny,—father and
two sons?”</p>

<p>“At Lone Pine Ranch?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, ra-ther. Dad, did I ever tell you
about——”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure you never missed a single
detail,” answered Mr. Beaumont, smilingly.
“Go on, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Well, a short time ago I got a letter from
our old friend Tim Lovell, whose father owns
a sheep ranch not so many miles from Circle
T. Tim says Border City has experienced a big
boom—lots of building operations are under
way, and a gas works is already completed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont’s business instincts were immediately
aroused.</p>

<p>“What has brought this change about,
Bob?” he asked, alertly.</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, the railroad was recently
extended to the town, so that many of
the cattle-ranchers who formerly drove their
stock to Creelton now ship from Border City.
The aviators had something to do with it, too.”</p>

<p>“How, I’d like to know?” asked Cranny.</p>

<p>“Oh, in a lot of ways,” answered Bob.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
“You see, a wealthy New York man interested
in dirigible balloons and aeroplanes
financed their experiments at Lone Pine
Ranch. Then, when the Aero Club of Wyoming
decided to hold a meet and give big
prizes for the speediest machine built in the
state, he came West.”</p>

<p>“So as to find some soft place for them to
fall on, I s’pose,” mumbled Willie.</p>

<p>“Where will this meet be held?” asked
Mr. Beaumont.</p>

<p>“At Border City.”</p>

<p>“At Border City?” echoed Cranny.</p>

<p>“Yes; this New York man, Major Warfield
Carroll, I think Tim called him, got busy
with the committee in charge. He offered to
stand a part of the expense if they’d hold it
at Border City.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Cranny.</p>

<p>“Well, Major Carroll’s aviator friends had
interested him in the place, first of all. Then
he discovered that Border City had possibilities—and
got the town’s people all worked
up over it; and some of the ranchers, too.
Anyway, the scheme has had the biggest kind
of a boost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Well, that’s going some!” cried Cranny.</p>

<p>“And Tim Lovell says we’d never know
the place,” broke in Sam Randall. “There’s
a big flour mill and grain elevator there now;
and——”</p>

<p>“A couple more hotels,” interrupted Dick
Travers, in his turn.</p>

<p>“So the ‘Black Bear’ and ‘Cattlemen’s
Retreat’ have rivals, eh?” grinned Cranny.
“Remember how each one tried to get ahead
of the other? I’ll bet, dad, I never told you
about——”</p>

<p>“Oh, at least half a dozen times,” laughed
Mr. Beaumont, spreading his hands in pretended
dismay. “What other news of Border
City have you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, land values have, of course, taken a
big boom; for employees of the various business
enterprises had to have homes. Why,
sir,—we didn’t really intend going to Circle
T Ranch. But when Tim told us about
all these things and the aviators at Lone
Pine——”</p>

<p>“And the meet which is just about to take
place,” supplemented Sam.</p>

<p>“We decided to take it in. And then, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
course, it’ll be jolly fun to be out on the
plains again.”</p>

<p>“And among the sheep raisers and cattlemen,”
put in Dick, his face beaming with
glee. “If you could only go along, Cranny!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” sighed Cranny, “if——”</p>

<p>He glanced at his father wistfully. Then
his eyes fell upon Willie Sloan’s grinning
face, and he felt that but for his woeful lack
of enthusiasm such a delightful experience
might have been possible. The mixture of
feelings so disturbed him that he scarcely
heard these words:</p>

<p>“Wonder if we’ll ever have an aeroplane,
Bob?”</p>

<p>Tommy Clifton had ventured to speak at
last. Tommy’s voice, like his stature, was
changing and his tone was of an astonishing
gruffness.</p>

<p>“I say, did you hear that, Cran?” exclaimed
Willie, in a loud whisper. “You’d
think it was a man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” snapped Cranny.</p>

<p>“Have an aeroplane?” Dick was saying,
with an eager note in his tone. “That’s so,
Bob—flying is one o’ the few things the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Ramblers haven’t done yet. Say, if we only
could——”</p>

<p>“A nice idea,” drawled Dave Brandon,
smiling. “Theoretically, I’ve been up a
number of times, and come down to earth
with a bang.”</p>

<p>“Been the real thing, I’ll bet you would
have bored a hole clean through to China,”
remarked Willie, calmly. “Guess the grass
never grows again on any spot where you
happen to fall.”</p>

<p>The stout boy good-naturedly joined in the
storm of merriment.</p>

<p>After dinner the party adjourned to the
drawing-room, where the conversation continued
to flow with uninterrupted vigor.</p>

<p>Cranny, his face aglow with pleasure, presently
wandered over to Willie.</p>

<p>“That kid’ll surely want to go the worst
kind o’ way, after hearing all this talk,” he
reflected. “Maybe it isn’t too late yet.”</p>

<p>“Say, Willie,” he said, in an aside,
“changed your mind, haven’t you? Don’t
you think it would be the greatest sport ever,
at Circle T? Come now, tell dad you’re right
in for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Oh, I don’t know,” responded Willie, indifferently.
“I never go in much for those
exciting stunts. Say, Cran, is China really
right beneath us?”</p>

<p>Cranny gazed fixedly at the diminutive
figure. “All right for you!” he snapped.
Then, fearful that Willie might say something
which would set the crowd to laughing
at him, he stalked away in disgust.</p>

<p>All too soon came the time for the Rambler
boys to go.</p>

<p>As Bob turned toward the door, Willie’s
voice rose above the others.</p>

<p>“I say, Ramblers,” he remarked, “don’t
you want to stay in the hay-loft? Nice place
up there.” He jerked his finger in the
direction of the stable and garage. “Ought
to seem natural. I guess your bunch
sleeps on the grass most of the time, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Many a night, with only the canopy of
heaven and the twinkling stars as a roof,”
answered Dave, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, that would never keep off the rain,”
piped Willie. “Say, Mr. Clifton!”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Tom, whose feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
had been considerably ruffled by Willie’s
impish glances.</p>

<p>“When a parade comes along, you’re right
in it, aren’t you? How does it feel——”</p>

<p>He stopped as a hand suddenly grasped
his collar, and he found himself being
dragged unceremoniously away.</p>

<p>“Get out of here, you pocket edition,”
sniffed Cranny. “What time to-morrow,
Bob? Sure the pater’ll let me off—eh, dad?—I
told you so! Yes, we’ll have a grand
day. Say, Bob”—Cranny leaned over, and,
putting his head close to the other’s ear,
whispered in earnest tones—“now, don’t
forget to talk it up for me.”</p>

<p>Bob nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>“How a chap can be as thin and long as
that Thomas Cliffy and yet live beats me all
hollow,” remarked Willie, as the four members
of the household stood on the porch
looking after the retreating figures. “Say,
Cran, what’s a pocket edition, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Look in the mirror, and one will be
staring you in the face,” snapped Cranny.
“That’s all the satisfaction you’ll get.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>PREPARATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> seemed just like being in Kingswood
again—to see those boys,” said Mrs. Beaumont,
as she and her husband and the two
lads gathered in the drawing-room. “What
a fine, lively lot they are; and isn’t it positively
extraordinary the way Tommy has
popped up? Did you like them, Willie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, kinder; seemed a bit fresh to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Willie!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t see anything remarkable
about them. That fat one thinks a heap of
himself, doesn’t he? Looks lazy, too. Better
overhaul all the chairs he sat on; if they
aren’t weakened, I’m surprised.”</p>

<p>But Cranny paid no attention. He had
withdrawn to a far corner of the room, with
his father, and was engaged in a low, earnest
conversation.</p>

<p>“Willie doesn’t care to go—that is easily
seen,” Mr. Beaumont was saying. His round,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
good-natured face lighted up with a quizzical
expression, as he regarded Cranny’s doleful
countenance. “Still, what Bob Somers said
this evening has made me reconsider my determination
not to let you go.”</p>

<p>“Eh—eh?” exclaimed Cranny, almost
stammering in his eagerness. “What! Do
you really mean it, dad?”</p>

<p>“That depends, son.”</p>

<p>“Upon what?”</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>Cranny sank into a chair with a great sigh
of relief. “Then it’s all settled,” he murmured.
“Great Scott! don’t you know I’m
capable of doing heroic stunts?”</p>

<p>“Cranny!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot, dad. But, for goodness’ sake,
do tell me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about Mr. Warfield Carroll; he
is a New York financier and promoter of recognized
ability. If Mr. Carroll has considered
Border City of sufficient importance to
warrant his taking a prominent part in its
development, I, as a business man, am inclined
to look into the conditions there.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha; a light breaks in upon me,” gurgled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Cranny, hilariously. “You want me—me—to
do the investigating; and put you wise
to——”</p>

<p>“Cranny!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir. My, but that certainly is
fine of you.”</p>

<p>He reached over and shook his father’s
hand with a vigor born of great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Trust me for doing it right. If I
don’t make a thorough job of it you may—may”—Cranny
stopped, in perplexity—“douse
my glim,” he added, with a happy
thought. “And then Willie won’t have to
go along, either, eh, dad? Just as you say,
he doesn’t seem to take any interest in Circle
T Ranch or——”</p>

<p>“Of course Willie will go,” said Mr. Beaumont,
quietly.</p>

<p>“Why—why—what’s the use?” demurred
Cranny. “After acting the way he has about
it, seems to me it would be better for him to
stay home and help at the office.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont smiled.</p>

<p>“And, when you come to think of it,” went
on Cranny, “for a tame little chap like Willie,
it’s kind of dangerous out among the cow-punchers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> 
and big herds of longhorns. Why,
I’ve seen——”</p>

<p>“How long have you thought so?” asked
his father, with a quizzical look.</p>

<p>“Why—that is—I—I——” stammered
Cranny. Then, as he suddenly realized his inconsistency,
he stopped short, with a rather
sickly grin. “It’s one on me, dad,” he admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont’s eyebrows knit, in mild reproof.</p>

<p>“It is human nature, Cranny, to argue from
whatever standpoint most closely affects our
own interests,” he said. “Now that you can
go irrespective of Willie, you are perhaps not
quite so willing to undertake the responsible
duties of looking after him. Do you still
think the boys may be able to liven him up—to
prod his slow nature into activity?”</p>

<p>“If they can’t, he’s a hopeless case,” answered
Cranny, anxious to redeem himself in
his father’s eyes. “A few weeks at Circle T
certainly ought to put some ginger into him.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think so, though your manner
of expressing it is not altogether elegant.
Now, of course, you may combine business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
with pleasure; but the main object is to post
me as well as you can. And if you consider
it advisable I shall come on. I know you are
young for such a mission, but——”</p>

<p>“Young? Why, goodness gracious, I’m
almost seventeen!” cried Cranny, in mild astonishment.</p>

<p>His father smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>“When you reach my age, seventeen will
not seem like a very long span of life.” He
raised his voice: “Willie!”</p>

<p>“Hey?” said Willie.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak to you a moment.”</p>

<p>“What have I done now, I wonder?” murmured
the boy.</p>

<p>He plumped himself down in a chair close
by, and, with his hands stuffed into his trousers
pockets, waited for his guardian to speak.</p>

<p>“Willie, I have decided to give you a vacation,”
said Mr. Beaumont. “You and Cranny
are to spend a few weeks in Wyoming, with
Bob Somers and his friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Willie.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you pleased?”</p>

<p>Willie pondered a moment.</p>

<p>“Oh, kinder,” he answered, “if they don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
get too fresh. Ha, ha! Cran worked it,
after all, didn’t he? So we’re going to that
old farmhouse, eh? Foxy lad! How’d you
do it, Cran?”</p>

<p>Willie’s impish grin increased. Then, suddenly,
he burst into a laugh which ended
with one of his peculiar little gasps. His
guardian certainly did not look pleased.</p>

<p>“Rather a surprise, this. Thanks,” added
the boy. “Maybe they won’t be glad to have
me along, Mr. Beaumont. Say, Cran, did you
ever notice what funny names some animals
have? Duck-billed platypus! What’s a
platypus, anyway, Cran?”</p>

<p>He grinned cheerfully, as an ominous gleam
shone in Cranny’s eyes.</p>

<p>Cranny didn’t sleep very much that night,
and when he did doze away it was to imagine
himself among the cowboys and out on the
plains, whirling amid all sorts of strange and
exciting adventures.</p>

<p>Next morning Willie went to the office with
Mr. Beaumont, as usual, but Cranny lingered
at the breakfast table until half-past eight.
Then he hastily jumped to his feet, dashed
out into the hall, clapped on his hat, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
another moment was striding over the graveled
path toward the gate.</p>

<p>“Won’t Bob Somers be surprised?” he
chuckled. “My land, but isn’t it the greatest
piece of luck! And perhaps, with all those
aeroplane stunts going on at Border City, we
may get a ride in the air.”</p>

<p>At length coming in sight of the National
Realty Building, the meeting place agreed
upon, he saw a small group gathered in front
of it, and, regardless of the passing crowd,
sent a loud whoop of greeting over the air, receiving
an immediate response.</p>

<p>Neither Bob nor his chums showed any
great surprise at the welcome news; any other
outcome would have astonished them greatly,
as Cranny was one of those lads who nearly
always manage to have their own way.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob, you chaps will have a big job
on your hands,” chuckled Cranny—“the job
o’ makin’ a man out of Willie Sloan.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he gave them a full account of
Willie’s early history, touching not lightly
upon his faults, and ending with the observation
that the lad was certainly—“some
queer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“I noticed that he didn’t join much in the
conversation last night,” grunted tall Tommy
Clifton, “and when he did make some remark
it was rude. Looked kind of grouchy to me.”</p>

<p>“In a way, he’s the cheekiest little rooster
in all Tacoma,” declared Cranny. “Your
work’s cut out for you, Bob.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Bob. “I’m sure the
crowd will do their best. Now, Cranny, to-morrow
morning——”</p>

<p>“Whoop! Makes me feel so great I can
hardly help dancing a jig right here,” cried
the big lad. “Come on! I’ll show you the
sights of Tacoma.”</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of a strenuous
day for the Ramblers. Tireless Cranny led
them from one point to another, until stout
Dave Brandon declared it to be the hardest
eight hours of tramping he had ever put in.</p>

<p>The boys again dined with Mr. Beaumont,
and during the evening assisted Cranny and
Willie to pack their belongings. When the
former announced that nothing further remained
to be done, they gave a cheer which
caused Willie to stare at them in astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Ginger! You chaps have a nerve to
startle me like that,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see us at the ranch,” laughed
Cranny, as he slipped on a well-worn cartridge
belt. “Gee, fellows, this feels natural. Look,
Bob!”—he held up a large revolver—“the
identical chap I had at Circle T! And there’s
my gun in the corner; it’s always been kept
in good condition.”</p>

<p>“Good boy,” said Bob, approvingly. “Our
arsenal is at the hotel. Glad you are going
along with us, Willie?” he asked, slapping
the lad on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, kinder. Only I wish we could ride
there in an aeroplane. Bet none of you chaps
would have the nerve to take a flyer.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you don’t know us,” said
tall Tom Clifton, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Clifton,” jeered Willie,
“aren’t——”</p>

<p>“Fellows”—Bob Somers’ clear voice interrupted
him—“I have an idea that before
this trip is over we may have some experience
with aeroplanes. Those aviators at Lone Pine
will——”</p>

<p>“Let us go up, sure as shootin’,” supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Cranny, his eyes beginning to sparkle with
interest.</p>

<p>“Which means that I’ll have to write a few
hundred pages more,” drawled Dave, who
was sprawling with careless ease on a chair by
the window. “For, of course,” he added,
with a chuckle, “we’ll get hold of a machine
somehow, and have it all to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” cried Sam. “Hooray for
the——”</p>

<p>“Rambler Club’s aeroplane!” chorused the
others, in lusty tones.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>BORDER CITY ONCE MORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> observation car of the Pullman train
speeding swiftly across the state of Wyoming
had perhaps never held a livelier crowd than
the Ramblers and their friends. All but Tom
Clifton and Willie Sloan seemed bubbling
over with good spirits, and were perfectly
willing that every one in the car should know
it.</p>

<p>Tommy, however, feeling that exhibitions
of mirth and glee were hardly dignified in
one who had so nearly reached the stupendous
height of six feet, only occasionally forgot
himself sufficiently to join in their merry
laughter. During the trip the look of discontent
had often vanished from Willie’s face.
He opened his eyes in wonderment as the
train lumbered up steep grades and across
magnificent mountain ranges.</p>

<p>The ever-changing views of rugged, gigantic
heights, of masses of bald rocks and forest-clad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> 
slopes, of cascades and rushing torrents
fiercely foaming and lashing their way between
barriers which sometimes approached
the tracks, even awakened within Willie a
feeling of enthusiasm. But he said very little,
and sat back in his seat sedately when there
was nothing particularly awe-inspiring to be
seen.</p>

<p>The wonderful mountain views were finally
left behind, and the heavy, labored puffing
of the locomotive resolved itself into swift
pulsating notes as more level stretches of
track were reached. Between low-lying hills,
their long undulating summits dropping
nearer and nearer to the plain, the Ramblers
were carried, until the train shot through an
opening in the final range and out upon a
great stretch of loam-covered prairie.</p>

<p>There were but few passengers on the car,
and the boys changed from side to side, or
walked about to suit their pleasure. Eagerness
showed in their bright expression and
voices as the miles were dropped behind,
each instant bringing them nearer to Border
City.</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe it’s true,” said Cranny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
hilariously. “Isn’t it great, Willie? Just
think—say, what you are staring at so hard,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering if Mr. Clifton uses
hair varnish,” piped Willie. “Hasn’t he got
the glossiest mop ever! Did you shave this
morning, Mr. Clifton?”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” mumbled Tommy.</p>

<p>“Not while we’re cuttin’ along at this rate,”
grinned Willie. “Say, Cran, is it really true
that the earth turns on its axle? I——”</p>

<p>“There’s the town, sure as I live!” called
out Sam Randall, excitedly, waving a field-glass.
“Yes siree, Bob Somers, it is.”</p>

<p>“Where away?” cried Cranny.</p>

<p>“To the right; see it?—Border City, fellows,
looking twice as natural as it ever did.
My! the place must have grown just as fast
as Tommy. Hooray! Won’t be long, now,
before we’re there.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet Jed Warren’ll be waiting for
us with the buckboard and some lively
bronchos,” roared Cranny. “You wrote
Mr. Follett when we’d arrive, eh, Bob? I
thought so. Yes; I can make out some
buildings now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“And, just think, to-night—old Circle T
Ranch again,” remarked Bob. “Won’t that
be jolly?”</p>

<p>With eager impatience the boys watched
the town of Border City coming into view.
There was no need of the field-glass now.
Outlined against a line of hills beyond, the
pale-colored buildings in the full glare of the
noonday sun were assuming definite form.</p>

<p>“Border City terminal!”</p>

<p>The conductor’s voice came to their ears
above the rumble of wheels. A sharp, crisp
blast from the locomotive whistle shrieked
its way across the plains; and the happy
and expectant crowd promptly flung to the
breeze a ringing chorus of shouts to keep it
company.</p>

<p>“I see something I never saw here before,”
cried Sam, a few moments later. “Look, Bob.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Sam—the gas works; and—and—by
Jove”—he seized the field-glass
from the other’s hand—“the hangar of a
dirigible balloon—must be Major Warfield
Carroll’s, eh? See it—just beyond that
clump of trees?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” cried Dick; “and there’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
long line of sheds; most likely to house the
aeroplanes.”</p>

<p>“And I notice mills of some kind, too”—the
voice came from Dave. “No mistake
about Border City taking a big boom, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Just wait till Cran gets in his licks,”
grinned Willie. “I’m here to keep him
right on the job. He was getting stale in
Tacoma. Did you speak, Mr. Clifton?”</p>

<p>“Not to you, William,” returned Tommy,
freezingly. “Bob, I can see the Black Bear
Hotel now.”</p>

<p>“And the Cattlemen’s Retreat, too,”
shouted Cranny. “Whoop! Don’t let the
cow-punchers scare you, Willie. There’s always
some loafing around.”</p>

<p>Another rasping whistle came over the air
as the train began to slacken its speed.
Straight ahead, the boys could see the shining
steel rails disappear beneath a train shed,
while above the roof rose a slender tower.
The platform was crowded.</p>

<p>“My goodness, how different from the
Border City we knew!” cried Bob. “Looks
like a real live town, now, eh, Dave?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Remarkable change,” murmured the stout
lad. “Wonder if the crowd will have as
lively a time out here as they did before.”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest doubt about it. The
Ramblers always manage to get mixed up
in some stirring events.”</p>

<p>Guns, suit cases and bundles were seized
by their respective owners; and when the
cars had given their final lurch, and the last
grind of the wheels had echoed sharply
through the train shed, the seven stood
ready to swing themselves off the platform.</p>

<p>They had scarcely alighted when a young
man dressed in regulation cowboy fashion,
wearing a blue shirt, leather chaps, a flowing
yellow handkerchief about his neck, and a
huge, broad-brimmed sombrero, made a dash
toward them, at the same time uttering a glad
shout of welcome.</p>

<p>“Jed Warren!” cried Bob, his face aglow
with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Wal—wal, I reckon you’re sure right,
pard,” exclaimed the cowboy, gleefully.
And in the attempt of the enthusiastic lads
to shake his hand at the same time bundles
were dropped and suit cases knocked over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Several of the loungers who made it a
point to meet nearly every train were vastly
entertained by this spectacle.</p>

<p>There were so many words and exclamations
crowded into the next few seconds that
no one knew exactly what any one else had
said, and the first distinct sentence came in a
shrill voice:</p>

<p>“My! What magazine cover did you escape
from, anyway?”</p>

<p>Jed Warren’s grinning face was immediately
turned toward the speaker.</p>

<p>“My father’s ward, Willie Sloan, Jed,” said
Cranny. “He’s out here to get some ginger
into his composition.”</p>

<p>“Say, do you wear those clothes because
they look nice, or because they feel good?”
asked Willie, when the operation of shaking
hands was over.</p>

<p>“Both,” answered Jed, with a good-natured
laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, you make me think of a moving
picture show. Are you going to stay here all
day? I never saw chins wag so fast in all my
life before.”</p>

<p>“Most as fast as that chap has grow’d up,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
grinned Jed, jerking his finger in the direction
of Tommy. “Wal, there’s somethin’ I
ain’t never seen the eq’al of—I sure ain’t.”</p>

<p>“And no one else has either, I guess,”
mumbled Willie, as he started off.</p>

<p>Outside the station, which was situated
close to the Black Bear Hotel, the general
store and post-office, the boys found Border
City presenting a busy scene. Several “rigs”
stood close by, and among them they saw
the familiar buckboard belonging to Circle T
Ranch. Back of it, tied to hitching-posts,
were four curiously-spotted bronchos, their
stamping hoofs and lashing tails giving sufficient
indication of their fiery, untamed
spirit.</p>

<p>“Whoop! If that isn’t the greatest ever!”
cried Cranny. “I know that bunch. No
buckboard for little Cranny.”</p>

<p>“Or for me,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“I feel in a generous mood,” laughed Dave;
“I’ll let Willie take my nag.”</p>

<p>“You’d get pinched for cruelty to animals,
if you ever tried to ride one of those poor
little beasts,” grunted Willie. “What makes
’em so full of ginger, Warren?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Them critters is the pick o’ Circle T
Ranch, young un,” responded Jed, impressively.
“Thar ain’t one but what’s a reg’lar
tornado an’ cyclone mixed together when he
gits hisself a-goin’ good. Don’t walk too
clos’t; their heels is liable to fly. I declare
I can’t git over seein’ this bunch ag’in.”</p>

<p>“When the Ramblers have been around it
generally takes an awful long time for some
one to recover,” said Willie. “I’ve been
through it myself. Oh, sugar! Is this town
rented out to a moving picture concern?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t never seen one o’ them picters,” admitted
Jed; “but if yer refer to cow-punchers
an’ sheep-men, thar’s a few still left; an’
most of ’em are good, squar’ fellers.”</p>

<p>The boys were quick to notice that the appearance
of the people of Border City had
also been considerably affected by the changed
conditions. The typical plainsman could still
be seen lounging around the Black Bear
Hotel and general store; but men in less picturesque
garb, and with an unmistakable air
of the East, or middle West predominated.</p>

<p>Substantial buildings of brick and frame
had sprung up on all sides, making the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
ramshackle houses of Border City appear,
by contrast, smaller and more forlorn-looking
than ever.</p>

<p>The sun, just overhead, blazed down on the
winding street; a yellow glare, full of simmering
heat waves, enveloped the surroundings;
and every foot or horse’s hoof that
struck the ground raised its little cloud of
choking dust.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, I see they call this Carroll
Avenue now,” sang out Bob, pointing to a
sign-post opposite.</p>

<p>“Major Carroll’s a fine chap,” pronounced
Jed. “Thar’s a-goin’ ter be some great doin’s
hyar purty soon, lads; an’ him an’ them aeroplane
fellers are the ones we kin thank fur it.
An’ say, Bob, mebbe them Lone Piners
weren’t glad to know your bunch was coming!”</p>

<p>“I remember the time when they weren’t
so glad to see us,” chirped Cranny, with a
reminiscent grin.</p>

<p>“An’ that’s whar ye’re just right,” laughed
Jed. “But things is different now. What’s
that, young un?”</p>

<p>“I were a-sayin’, pard, as how I’m hotter’n<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
a fried egg,” grunted Willie, with fine mimicry.
“Let’s go somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Sure—over to that hangar; we might get
a peep at Mr. Carroll’s dirigible,” cried Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness; not now,” demurred Dave.
“I’m ’most famished; and uncommonly
sleepy, besides. Aren’t you hungry, Willie?”</p>

<p>“Kinder.”</p>

<p>“Would ye like ter hit the trail fur Circle
T Ranch, youngster?” asked Jed, with a quizzical
smile.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Say something else once or twice a day,”
snapped Cranny. “Sure, Jed, we’d better
hike over there as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>“Hip, hip, hurrah for the ranch!” cried
Sam, making a break toward the bronchos.</p>

<p>The crowd, with their guns, suit cases and
bundles, attracted considerable attention, but
only Tommy Clifton seemed to be disturbed
by the sounds of laughter which came from
several cattlemen lounging in front of the
Black Bear Hotel.</p>

<p>The discontented look had returned with
full force to Willie Sloan’s face. He was
tired; and the yellow glare and yellow dust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
made him devoutly wish that he and Border
City were miles apart.</p>

<p>Tommy had intended to take a seat in the
buckboard, but upon hearing a remark from
Willie which seemed to indicate no great opinion
of his prowess as a broncho rider, he reconsidered.</p>

<p>“What, Mr. Clifton, air ye a-goin’ ter ride?”
asked Willie, mockingly. “Why, say, pard,
ye’ll hev ter hold yer feet up, or ye’ll furrow
the prairie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you an astronomer some day,
William—astronomers see stars, you know,”
quoth Tom, highly exasperated.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll never see a star in you,” retorted
Willie, impudently.</p>

<p>Dave had already seated himself in the
buckboard, and Willie climbed indolently up
beside him, while Sam, yielding to Dick Travers’
earnest request to ride one of the bronchos,
also took his place in the rig.</p>

<p>It wasn’t an easy matter to dispose of their
belongings, especially as some of them had to
be strapped to the mustangs’ backs, and these
little beasts were absolutely averse to such a
proceeding. But, in spite of wildly gyrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
bodies, wicked snorts and glaring eyes, the
work was finally accomplished.</p>

<p>Even Willie’s tired air vanished, as he
watched the boys spring into the saddle and
stick there, although their mounts seemed to
jump about as though endowed by nature
with springs of steel.</p>

<p>“Oh, just look at Mr. Clifton!” roared
Willie. “My, oh, my! Hold your feet up,
Thomas. Gee! There’ll be seventeen hundred
holes in the earth by the time we reach
the farmhouse. Look——”</p>

<p>The sharp cracking of Jed Warren’s quirt,
followed by a sudden jolt of the buckboard,
ended Willie’s sentence. There was a clatter
of horses’ hoofs and the swift whirr of rapidly-revolving
wheels, and thick clouds of
dust began to trail behind them.</p>

<p>The extent of Border City’s development
surprised the Ramblers. They were quickly
whirled past the new Carroll Inn, a grain elevator,
the Wyoming Flour Company’s big mill
adjoining, and, upon turning a bend in the
crooked street, saw rows of neat little houses.</p>

<p>“The wheels of industry have surely begun
to turn in earnest here,” laughed Dave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
“Doesn’t it show what a real live-wire man
can do?”</p>

<p>“Cran will short-circuit that chap all right,”
grunted Willie, “an’ then they’ll have another
street—Cranberry Bog Avenue. Gee!
I don’t believe that careless driver’ll ever let
us reach the farmhouse alive.”</p>

<p>Presently the prairie opened out before
them, hemmed in by a line of hills. Over its
broad, flat surface the buckboard traveled at
a rattling pace. The boys on the bronchos
rode far in advance, their shouts of glee often
flung to the air. By the time the vehicle had
crossed a rocky pass in the hills the riders
were no longer in sight.</p>

<p>Within a short time Jed was driving close
to great herds of cattle, some browsing amidst
the buffalo grass, while others ambled slowly
through fields of tumbleweed.</p>

<p>Even the jolting of the buckboard could not
prevent Dave from falling into a doze, and
Willie, taking little interest in his surroundings,
sat huddled up, his eyes half closed.</p>

<p>“Hip, hip, hooray!” yelled Sam Randall,
with startling abruptness. “Hooray! There
it is! Whoop!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“What—what?” cried Willie, in affright.</p>

<p>“Circle T Ranch, you little goose!”
snapped Sam. “Look—just beyond that rise.”</p>

<p>And Willie, with his eyes now wide open,
saw straight ahead a long, low building shining
brightly in the sunlight.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>AT THE RANCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ranch-house was a solid, time-stained
structure, its thick stone walls pierced at intervals
by loopholes, for Circle T had been
built at a period when bands of Indians on
the war-path endangered the lives and property
of the settlers.</p>

<p>Mr. Follett, a pleasant-looking gentleman
whose brown beard and hair were streaked with
gray, stood on the wide porch talking to the
boys, his face wreathed in smiles, as the buckboard
rolled up.</p>

<p>Almost before the wheels had ceased revolving,
he hurried over to shake hands with the
latest arrivals.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how pleased I am, boys,”
he said, heartily. “And all your roughing-it
experiences, Dave, haven’t thinned you a bit.
Ah—and this is Willie Sloan! Bob has been
talking to me about you, son. And Sam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Randall, too! My goodness, how natural it
seems to have all you lads here again.”</p>

<p>A slender youth suddenly darted from behind
a pillar of the porch.</p>

<p>“Tim Lovell!” exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>“Tim!” echoed Sam, heartily.</p>

<p>And then there was more hand-shaking and
exclamations; and by the time calmness had
been restored Jed Warren and the buckboard
had disappeared behind the sheds in the rear
of the ranch-house.</p>

<p>Willie Sloan looked about him with interest,
but did not seem enthusiastic at the
prospect of remaining several weeks at the
ranch.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p080">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p080.jpg" alt="WHAT CAN A CHAP DO OUT HERE?">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“WHAT CAN A CHAP DO OUT HERE?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Ginger! What can a chap do out here?”
he grumbled, speaking to Bob. “Don’t like
it?—Why, say, what in the dickens is there
to like about it? Ride bronchos, eh? Not
much! I’d like to punch Cran for getting me
out here; yes, I should. Only wish I was back
in Tacoma.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up,” sniffed Tommy. “Don’t begin
to blubber.”</p>

<p>“I’ll whale somebody of your length in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>few minutes,” returned Willie, his grin suddenly
returning. “Speaking to me, sir?” he
added, raising his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; won’t you boys come inside? After
such a long ride, you must be tired,” remarked
Mr. Follett. “We’ll have an early supper.”</p>

<p>“And uncommonly glad I am, too,” murmured
Dave Brandon. “Say, fellows, don’t
the mountains look fine?”</p>

<p>“How can a streak o’ blue look fine?”
grunted Willie, as his eyes turned toward the
jagged peaks of the distant range. “Stop
dreaming, David B.”</p>

<p>The first floor of the ranch-house contained
two apartments, the larger used as a dining-room.
There was a great deal in it, too, which
should have aroused the interest of any wide-awake
lad—objects of the chase, mounted in
lifelike attitudes, besides Indian relics and
firearms, arranged artistically about the
walls; but Willie merely yawned.</p>

<p>“My, but don’t I wish I hadn’t come,” he
mumbled in a scarcely audible voice. “Ride
bronchos? Oh, ginger!”</p>

<p>Up-stairs, the boys found three cool, inviting
rooms already prepared for their reception.
They soon washed, and changed their traveling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
clothes for the more comfortable khaki
suits which they had brought with them.</p>

<p>“Christopher! If I’d known I was going
to look like a Boy Scout, I’d have raised
kick,” grinned Willie, when they had assembled
down-stairs again. “Say, what’s-your-name!”</p>

<p>Tim turned, as a sharp elbow dug against
his ribs.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s about Mr. Clifton,” said Willie, in a
loud whisper. “Look out for yourself. I
caught him at it!”</p>

<p>“Caught him at what?”</p>

<p>“Readin’ a book on first aid to the injured.
An’ he’s got a whole lot o’ others ’bout anatomy.
If you ever get tossed from your mustang,
maybe he’ll want to do some stunts with
you.”</p>

<p>“Tommy’s going to be a doctor,” grinned
Tim.</p>

<p>“Help!” murmured Willie.</p>

<p>“And Bob’s all for the law.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be all in when it comes to the exams,”
snickered Willie. “Bet he fails worse——”</p>

<p>“And Dave is——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>But whatever information Tim seemed
about to impart regarding the stout boy’s
future was abruptly interrupted by the noisy
entrance of three cow-punchers. Big, brawny
men they were, too. And the moment their
eyes rested on the boys they voiced a loud,
hearty welcome.</p>

<p>“Sam Skillet, Wyoming Tom and Straight-backed
Pete Sanderson!” cried Bob, as the
crowd rushed forward to shake their hands.</p>

<p>The first thing which forcibly struck Willie
Sloan was that Sam Skillet possessed a voice
of the most extraordinary power; and the
second, that Wyoming Tom, the half-breed,
was the perfect picture of an outlaw. Willie
stared hard at them with unabashed curiosity,
and hesitatingly placed his small white
hand into the huge brown paws which the
cow-punchers, each in turn, held toward him.</p>

<p>“Yes, them fellers over to Lone Pine hev
been a-goin’ up in their air-ship most every
day, Bob.” Skillet’s great voice rang through
the room. “An’ if it ain’t the wonderfulest
thing ye may call me a maverick to onct.”</p>

<p>“Maverick! What’s a maverick?” asked
Willie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I’ll tell you,” answered Cranny. “A good
many years ago, a man named Maverick went
out to Texas to run a ranch. He was such a
soft-hearted chap that he’d never brand a steer
or slice its ears, an’ the way dishonest stockmen
swiped them was simply awful. Out
here, they sometimes call an easy mark a
maverick.”</p>

<p>“Wal, as I were about to say, them air-ships
flies jist like birds,” went on Sam Skillet;
“but ye’d never ketch me a-goin’ up in one,
pard; no—not fur a thousand head o’ the
finest bullocks in Wyoming.”</p>

<p>“Nor me, nuther,” grunted the half-breed,
decidedly.</p>

<p>“Only hope I get a chance at it,” laughed
Bob.</p>

<p>Pete Sanderson regarded him with a peculiar
expression.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve got a heap o’ pluck, young un,” he
said. “But ye’d best take my advice, an’
leave them thar things alone. It ain’t nateral
fur a man ter fly—weren’t never intended.”</p>

<p>“Only when the sheriff gets hot on his
trail,” grinned Cranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Why don’t they punch cows with aeroplanes,
Mr. Clifton?” inquired Willie.</p>

<p>Tommy frowned fiercely, but made no reply,
whereupon Willie, delighted, flopped himself
down on the nearest chair.</p>

<p>That evening every one had something to
say about the astonishing increase in Tommy’s
height and the lad’s diffidence increased in
ratio to the number of times such remarks
were made.</p>

<p>Willie, too, added to his discomfort by addressing
him as Doctor Clifton, necessitating
upon Tommy’s part a recital of his newly-awakened
ambition to some day become a
member of the medical profession.</p>

<p>A Mexican, José Miguel Valdez, waited
upon the table, while the boys had occasional
glimpses of the cook, Jake Montgomery Talbot
Hart, generally known as Sambo.</p>

<p>It seemed very pleasant to have every comfort
and convenience in the big room of the
ranch-house, and yet be situated right in the
midst of a vast stretch of rolling prairie.
The men told interesting stories of life on the
range, and of former warfares between cattlemen
and sheep raisers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Willie began to liven up a bit, his half-impertinent
remarks sometimes causing a ripple
of mirth.</p>

<p>Naturally, much of the conversation turned
upon the great boom at Border City, and its
creators, Major Warfield Carroll and the aviators.</p>

<p>“I declare to goodness, I’m going over to
Lone Pine mighty soon,” announced Cranny,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Wal, look out for yerself,” warned Pete
Sanderson. “I tell ye ’tweren’t never intended
fur no man ter fly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” laughed Cranny.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob; we drive our stock now to
Border City,” Mr. Follett was saying, “and
so do many of the other ranchmen. Great
improvements have been made since your
last visit. Miles and miles of telephone wires
are now strung out over the prairie, and
many small sub-stations built. There are
places where my foreman”—his hand indicated
Sam Skillet—“or any of the cow-punchers
can call me up whenever occasion
demands it.”</p>

<p>“That’s great,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Then, of course, we have a wire to Border
City.”</p>

<p>“Ever talk to Major Carroll over the
’phone?” asked Cranny.</p>

<p>“Many times.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind if I called him up? I’d
like to tell him there’s a bunch o’ live-wire
chaps out here, and all o’ them hopin’ to get
a chance to examine that dirigible balloon o’
his.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you may,” said the ranchman,
good-naturedly. “You’ll find the ’phone over
there in that corner.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the best I can for you, fellows,”
chirped Cranny.</p>

<p>“Let Mr. Clifton ’phone,” suggested Willie.
“Carroll’ll think it’s a man.”</p>

<p>Cranny’s vigorous “Hello!” presently
sounded. But, to his disappointment, he
found that the voice at the other end of
the wire belonged to one of Major Carroll’s
mechanicians.</p>

<p>“The boss isn’t here,” he heard. “A
crowd of boys want to see the balloon? Yes,
I’ll tell him. At Circle T Ranch, are you?
Call us up some time to-morrow. Good-bye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Why not have a word or two with your
friends at Lone Pine?” suggested Mr. Follett.</p>

<p>“A jolly good idea,” cried Cranny, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Mr. Follett showed Cranny how to get the
proper wire, and the big lad was presently
roaring:</p>

<p>“Hello; this is Cranny Beaumont!—C-r-a-n-n-y!
Do you get me? Ha, ha!
That you, Mr. Ogden? Yes; Bob Somers
and the whole crowd are here. Been expecting
us, hey? Thanks awfully. Oh, fine
and dandy. When?—Just wait a second.”</p>

<p>Cranny swung quickly around.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he sang out, “Mr. Ogden wants
us to run over to Lone Pine day after to-morrow;
how about it? He says they are
going to try out a new air-ship that day.
Whoop!”</p>

<p>“Why, of course we will,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Ogden; the bunch is comin’,”
shouted Cranny, over the wire. “How long?
A few weeks, perhaps. What—I? Oh, I’m
out here on business.”</p>

<p>“Listen to that!” chirruped Willie. “On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
business! What an awful one. Much business
he’ll attend to.”</p>

<p>“Here, Bob, Mr. Ogden wants to speak to
you.”</p>

<p>Bob took Cranny’s place at the ’phone, and
held quite an extended conversation with Mr.
Benjamin Ogden, the inventor, father of
Robert and Ferdinand. And the younger
men, too, sent their voices over the slender
wire which stretched across the great prairie.</p>

<p>“Wal, arter all, pards, ye’re a-goin’ ter do it,
hey?” growled Pete Sanderson, shaking his
head disapprovingly. “’Tain’t nateral ter fly:
’tweren’t intended nohow.”</p>

<p>Sam Skillet, whose huge frame blocked the
doorway, agreed.</p>

<p>“No; I ’low as it ain’t,” he added. “But
when them thar youngsters set their minds
on doin’ anythin’, Pete, outlaw bronc’s couldn’t
stop ’em.”</p>

<p>And Cranny, with a loud laugh, “opined”
that he was right.</p>

<p>“I shall expect you boys to exercise the
greatest care,” said Mr. Follett.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about us,” spoke up Bob.
“We’ll be careful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“An’, besides, they’ll have Doc Clifton
along,” squeaked Willie. “Do I want to go
to Lone Pine? Oh, I may as well.”</p>

<p>“You can’t ride a broncho, William,”
snorted Tommy.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to,” snapped Willie.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’ll bet we have some dandy
fun,” declared Cranny, in enthusiastic tones.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>AT LONE PINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lone Pine Ranch</span> was situated not so many
miles from Circle T, on the other side of a
river whose waters cut an erratic course
through the prairie. A straight line drawn
between the houses would have passed across
a wide stretch of yellow alkali plain, dotted
with great sandstone buttes and patched with
clumps of huge spiked cacti.</p>

<p>In another direction, however, the prairie
was covered with a growth of buffalo grass and
occasional clumps of trees. Over this rich
feeding ground Mr. Follett’s immense herds of
longhorns roamed for miles and miles, even
beyond Lone Pine Ranch. Standing isolated
on the broad plain, the appearance of the solid
ranch-house was strongly suggestive of the
early pioneer days and Indian warfare. Close
by stood a long, low building formerly used
as a stable, and encircling both was a high
stockade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>About the middle of the morning a cavalcade
of youthful horsemen cantered briskly
up before the entrance.</p>

<p>“I declare, that little chap is a nuisance,”
grumbled Tom Clifton. “The buckboard is
at least a mile behind. Why, he hasn’t a bit
of pluck. Jed offered him the tamest nag in
the stable. Crickets! Even then he was
afraid.”</p>

<p>“But you must remember that a city lad
can’t be expected to ride bronchos,” laughed
Bob. “He isn’t a seasoned veteran like you,
Tom.”</p>

<p>Tom drew himself up with conscious pride.</p>

<p>“I know, Bob; but I had to make a start.
Say, Cranny, isn’t he the freshest little dub?
If he weren’t your father’s ward, I’d have
taught him a lesson before this.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” roared Cranny. “How wee
Willie in the buckboard would tremble if he
only heard that. Whoa, boy—whoa! Bet
the sight of those longhorns has given him
the shivers. See any one in the ranch-house,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then let’s give a rousing yell. Whoa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
you pesky little beast. Ho, ho! Remember
that big pine, fellows? Wonder if any of the
charred hills are left.”</p>

<p>“It was a dandy old tree,” said Tim Lovell,
his words somewhat disconnected by the erratic
movements of his lively little broncho.</p>

<p>“Didn’t take our old friend Hap Hazard
long to do the business for it, though,” roared
Dick. “Dave, let’s hear you try to make a
noise like an Indian.”</p>

<p>“Give a good old cowboy yell,” said
Cranny. “Gee Whitaker, but isn’t this just
like old times! Bother the buckboard!
Come on.”</p>

<p>A touch of his spurs, and the broncho shot
straight as an arrow through the stockade entrance.
The others swiftly followed.</p>

<p>The unsightly piles of rubbish which once
lay about the enclosure had been cleared
away, while weeds and straggling bushes no
longer grew about in luxuriant profusion.
Even the charred stump of the ancient pine
was gone.</p>

<p>The pounding of horses’ hoofs, together with
the whoops of six lusty-voiced boys, quickly
roused the ranch-house. The heavy oaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
door began to creak on its hinges, and before
the bronchos had cantered up three men
appeared on the steps.</p>

<p>“Hooray for the Lone Piners!” yelled
Cranny, taking off his sombrero and waving
it vigorously. “Good-morning! Whoop!
Here we are again!”</p>

<p>“So I see, and just as lively as ever,” responded
the youngest of the trio, smiling
with pleasure. “Boys, we extend a most
hearty welcome. The plains have seemed
mighty dull since you left.”</p>

<p>“Very true, Ferd,” put in his father.
“Just picket your horses, boys, and come
right in.”</p>

<p>Most of the lads had vaulted from their
saddles by the time these words were spoken,
and, in a marvelously short time, pins were
driven deep into the ground and the bronchos
tethered. Then followed an enthusiastic
shaking of hands, while questions and answers
flew thick and fast.</p>

<p>There was so much to talk about and so
many explanations to give that no one had
made a move to enter the house when a buckboard
driven by Jed Warren passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the entrance in the stockade wall and rattled
toward them.</p>

<p>“Hello! Who is that?” exclaimed Rob
Ogden, in surprise.</p>

<p>Cranny Beaumont explained.</p>

<p>“If I ever cross that blooming prairie again,
I’ll know it; and so will every one else,”
grumbled Willie Sloan, hopping out of the
buckboard before it had stopped. “Goodness
gracious, Warren, you don’t know how to
drive. Say, Cran, I don’t wonder, now, that
they punch the cattle, if the beasts are all as
ugly as those we passed. Mr. Ogden? Glad
to meet you, sir; and you too, sirs. Haven’t
they got the longest horns? Oh, my, I mean
the cattle, of course. Anyone injured yet,
Mr. Clifton? Going in the old farmhouse,
eh? Some day I’ll pound Cran for getting
me out here.”</p>

<p>The lower floor of the house was divided
into large, heavily-raftered rooms. Even a
shaft of sunlight, stealing through one of the
half-open windows and striking upon the opposite
wall, failed to remove a pervading air
of gloom.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Cran, I don’t like this a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
bit,” exclaimed Willie, frankly. “I’m going
out on the steps.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of spooks, I suppose!” sniffed
Tommy.</p>

<p>“You an’ I’ll meet in the dueling arena
some day, Mr. Clifton,” returned Willie, as
he retraced his steps.</p>

<p>Cranny laughed.</p>

<p>“And to think that I told dad they ought
to get chummy,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Yes, boys, you may examine our machines,”
said Mr. Ogden, Senior, in response to a question
from Bob Somers. “We have built
three; and the ‘Ogden III’ is the one which
is entered for the coming meet.”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t the very latest word in aeroplanes
I’m much mistaken,” remarked Ferd.
“Know anything about ’em, boys?”</p>

<p>“We hope to acquire a good deal of knowledge
before leaving Lone Pine,” answered
Dave, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“And I’ve no doubt you will. Let’s go
now, father.”</p>

<p>“Impatient youth must be served, I suppose,”
acquiesced the other, smilingly.</p>

<p>“Where’s wee Willie, I wonder?” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Cranny, when they had filed out on
the steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’d be afraid to go very far away,”
said Tommy. “Don’t bother about him.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t causin’ my brow to become furrowed
with wrinkles,” grinned Cranny.</p>

<p>The crowd, closely following the inventor
and his sons, cut diagonally across to the opposite
building, and, upon turning its corner,
discovered Willie pulling aside a flap of the
most curious-looking tent they had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Look out, son—for goodness’ sake don’t
touch anything!” cried Mr. Ogden, hastily.</p>

<p>“Who’s touching anything, I’d like to
know?” mumbled Willie, disconcertedly.
“What’s in there?”</p>

<p>“That is the ‘Ogden II,’” answered the inventor,
good-naturedly. “Not nearly so fine
as our latest model,” he added. “The aeroplane
tent, boys, is quite a new departure,
designed in order that experiments may be
carried on wherever we choose, without the
necessity of building hangars.”</p>

<p>“Dandy!” cried Beaumont. “But isn’t it
a whopping big machine, Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“The spread of the planes is about forty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> 
feet; you shall see it presently. Interested
in aeroplanes, too?” he asked, turning
toward Willie.</p>

<p>“Oh, a little. Say, does it really fly?”</p>

<p>“Like a bird,” laughed Robert.</p>

<p>“It’ll sure never go up with my hundred
and seventy-five pound in it,” said Jed Warren,
decidedly. “Goin’ to git it out? I’ll
give ye a hand, boys.”</p>

<p>By degrees the great aeroplane was drawn
from its shelter, while the boys crowded
around, examining every part of its mechanism
exposed to view with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>They saw two horizontal fabric-covered
frames forty-five feet in length by seven wide,
set apart a vertical distance of six feet,
joined together by strong uprights. These
constituted the two planes. From the center,
at the rear, a long framework extended backward
and was provided at its extremity with
two vertical rudders and a horizontal tail-piece.
Behind the two seats for the aviators
stood a seven-cylinder engine, with a pair
of propellers operated by chain gearing ranged
on either side. Two small horizontal planes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
designed to aid in balancing the machine, as
well as to assist in its elevating, were situated
in front of the main planes.</p>

<p>The aeroplane rested on rubber-tired swivel
wheels, two under the forward plane, the
others placed near the end of the tail. The
lads noticed springs, too, as a precaution
against damage when alighting.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it, boys?”
asked Mr. Ogden.</p>

<p>“It’s a bird,” said Willie. “Say, what
are those little shutters for?” He pointed
toward several flaps fastened to the main
plane.</p>

<p>“Those we call aillerons, or balancing
wings,” explained Rob, “and they are
worked by an automatic arrangement in
such a manner that when one falls another
rises, tending to steady the plane laterally.”</p>

<p>“What is the machine made of?” asked
Sam.</p>

<p>“The frame is of hard wood; the covering
of varnished fabric, while the various
parts are connected by wire stays. You will
observe that the planes are slightly curved;
that is to prevent the air from escaping too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
freely from beneath, and gives more lifting
power.”</p>

<p>“How is the aeroplane operated?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Its movements are controlled by levers;
this one, for instance, operates the elevating
planes in front; and this moves the main
planes, for the frame is jointed, you see,
allowing the surfaces to be warped to a certain
extent. These pedals control the rudder
and tail.”</p>

<p>“But what in the world makes it go up?”
asked Willie.</p>

<p>“Well, William actually seems to be waking
up a bit at last,” grunted Tommy.</p>

<p>“When the engine is started, the aeroplane
is propelled swiftly over the ground. Naturally,
the air is at once forced beneath the
planes, exerting a powerful pressure upon
their surfaces. Now, it follows that unless
the aeroplane has sufficient weight to push
this air downward or aside the machine is
bound to overcome the force of gravity and
rise.”</p>

<p>“Like a kite, I s’pose,” said Willie.</p>

<p>“Yes; and the faster the pair of powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
propellers revolve the stronger, of course, becomes
this air pressure,” added Rob. “By
reducing the speed of the engine, the aeroplane
can be made to descend; and, I tell
you, boys, volplaning, with the power shut
off, is great sport.”</p>

<p>“Volplaning! What’s that?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“It is simply gliding downward through
space,” said Dave Brandon. “I’ve seen some
aviators who almost rivaled the ease and
grace of birds in soaring to earth from great
heights.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Dave knows all about aeroplanes,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“Only a little, and that in theory,” laughed
the stout boy.</p>

<p>“To be a bird-man requires a cool head
and a steady hand,” said Mr. Ogden. “One
needs to be continually on his guard against
treacherous air currents; although over a
broad plain, like the one we have out here,
aeroplaning is comparatively safe.”</p>

<p>“But near the hills and mountains it’s
mighty different,” remarked Ferd. “A stiff
breeze meeting these obstructions is deflected
off into all sorts of swirls and waves, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the machine difficult to manage. One minute
we may be traveling against a wind of a certain
velocity, only to find ourselves suddenly
plunged into another entirely different, or
one cutting across at an angle.”</p>

<p>“And that is where the quickness of brain
and hand come into play,” put in Mr. Ogden.
“The aviator, no matter how careful he may
be, is always liable to be taken by surprise.”</p>

<p>“Well, it must be dandy sport, anyway,”
cried Cranny, “an’ I know you’re just achin’
to take one o’ us up, right now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let it be Mr. Clifton,” said Willie,
with one of his impish grins. “We may
need him and his first-aid-to-the-injured book
yet.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be needing somebody’s aid pretty
soon, I’m thinking,” murmured Tom, hotly.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we may as well get ready
for our flight, Ferd,” remarked Mr. Ogden.
“Want to go up, Jed?”</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckon not. I sure ain’t hankerin’
ter land kerflunk among a herd o’ longhorns.”</p>

<p>“Then, as you are out of the running, who
shall it be? Whoever wishes to experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the novel sensation of aeroplaning will be
given a chance. But——”</p>

<p>“Hooray—hooray!” yelled Cranny, excitedly,
amidst a burst of cheers. “Shall I
climb aboard now, Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“But, as I was about to say, it seems fitting
that the first candidate for the honor should
be——”</p>

<p>“Bob Somers!” cried Tommy, with all
his force.</p>

<p>And every one but Cranny immediately
raised his voice in a loud roar of assent.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>IN THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Much</span> obliged, fellows,” laughed Bob,
“but I’m willing to step aside if Cranny is so
anxious to get the first crack at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bob—I’ll go the second
trip,” grinned Cranny, good-naturedly.
“Only don’t hang the machine up in the
clouds. It will be hard to wait for you.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been waiting seventeen long years
for this; and ten minutes more won’t do you
a bit o’ harm,” chirped Willie.</p>

<p>“Oh, run along,” snapped Cranny. “Get
out of the way, now! Can’t you see the
machine is headed right toward you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden had already clambered to his
place in the aviator’s seat. Bob followed, and
eased himself down on a cushion close beside
him, with his feet resting against a wooden bar.</p>

<p>“Mr. Aviator, what’s that big thing by the
side of your head—a torpedo?” asked Willie.</p>

<p>“That is the gasoline tank,” explained Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Ogden, “and there is enough fuel in it to
carry the machine for over one hundred miles.
Remember, Bob, the roar of the engine will
prevent much conversation in mid-air; so, in
case you should begin to feel nervous, just
give me a nudge—I’ll understand.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about me,” laughed Bob, as
he looked down and ran his hand along the
leather belt which stretched across his seat.
“This will hold me in.”</p>

<p>“Well, dizziness or light-headedness is very
apt to come without warning during the first
ascent. I shall rely upon you to keep perfectly
still.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir,” said Bob. “Oh! Nearly all
of the stockade on the far side has been removed,
hasn’t it? I was so interested I didn’t
notice it before.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden smiled.</p>

<p>“We did that ourselves, Bob,” he said, “and
for obvious reasons. You needn’t think it
was the work of your friend, Hap Hazard.”</p>

<p>“Everything all ready!” called out Don.
“Keep a safe distance away, boys.”</p>

<p>“Now we’re off!” said Mr. Ogden to his
passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Bob Somers felt a thrill run through him.
Grasping the supports, he awaited the momentous
instant and found himself studying the
face of the aviator, and vaguely wondering at
his apparent unconcern.</p>

<p>“Ready, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Ready, sir!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden waved his hand, and his assistants
gave the propellers a quick twirl.</p>

<p>A pulsating roar immediately sounded.
The great plane, responding almost instantly
to the rapid revolutions, began to glide over
the smooth ground, slowly at first, then gathering
speed, until, light as a bird, it rose into
the air.</p>

<p>Bob Somers held his breath as the ground
fell behind them. The wide break in the
stockade appeared to open out to the right and
left. Just a few seconds more, and the biplane,
almost as gently as a sheet of paper
taken up and wafted away on the breeze, lifted
itself gently upward.</p>

<p>Swifter and swifter it moved; higher, still
higher it rose, until broad reaches of prairie
were disclosed to view.</p>

<p>Bob Somers began to experience a series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
strange sensations. He seemed almost suspended
without support in space. Below him
he saw the ranch-house and outbuildings of
Lone Pine, seemingly flattened against the
prairie floor, while the boys and bronchos had
already been left far to the rear. Everywhere
great herds or scattered groups of cattle were
coming into sight.</p>

<p>Bob’s greatest surprise was the strength of
the wind that blew against his face, forcing
him at times to shield his eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden frequently glanced at his passenger,
and judged from his expression that he
felt no fear or nervousness.</p>

<p>The biplane gradually turned in a wide circle—the
planes tipped slightly, just enough, it
seemed, to add a spice of danger—and they
were headed back in the direction of Lone
Pine.</p>

<p>To the aviator the flight was one of the
lowest he had ever taken, yet to Bob the altitude
appeared unpleasantly high, causing him
more than once to clutch the stout leather
strap which held him securely to his seat.</p>

<p>Speed such as an aeroplane makes seems to
simply annihilate distance. It seemed only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
a moment before the flying machine had
reached Lone Pine again and was shooting by
with a steady sweep. Bob could see that the
boys had mounted their bronchos and were
galloping about, waving their hands in greeting.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll be quite satisfied if Mr. Ogden
doesn’t ascend any higher,” thought Bob,
with a grim smile. He tried to accustom
himself to studying the swift-moving objects
below. Then, as the roar from the engine at
his back lessened, a feeling of relief shot
through him. His head had begun to feel a
trifle queer.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Ogden skilfully piloted the machine,
sending it still lower. As it took the
curves, the planes, assailed by the breeze
which struck full against them, wobbled and
shivered.</p>

<p>The boys were almost straight ahead, widely
separated over the plain and keeping a safe
distance from the ranch-house, in order to
give the navigator of the air a chance to land.</p>

<p>“He’s going to volplane now,” mused Bob,
presently.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden had stopped his engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>A delightful, easy gliding motion downward
through space immediately followed. Bob
Somers, lying back in his seat, saw, with a
thrill of pleasure, the buildings and stockade
apparently swinging swiftly toward them.</p>

<p>Another series of rapid throbs came from the
motor; the “Ogden II” slackened its pace
until it seemed to be almost hovering over
the ground. A few moments later, the machine
settled down, the springs and rubber-tired
wheels so absorbing the shock of impact
that Bob Somers felt only a gentle bump.</p>

<p>When he stepped to the ground the odd
sensation of light-headedness seemed only to
increase; there was a vague impression as of
objects being still in motion. His footing
seemed insecure. Bob, however, with a shrug
of his shoulders, quickly pulled himself together.</p>

<p>“Glorious—simply immense, fellows!” he
cried, enthusiastically, as, with loud whoops,
the broncho riders came cantering toward
them. “Greatest thing out.”</p>

<p>“It’s surely the greatest thing to be in,”
laughed Cranny. “My turn next.”</p>

<p>“Come off!” protested Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Not off the aeroplane.” Cranny grinned.
“Here comes wee Willie.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” growled Tom.</p>

<p>“You’re lookin’ kinder pale, Somers,” commented
Mr. Beaumont’s ward, ambling up.
“Feel weak in the legs, I’ll bet. No, I’m not
going to take a fly, Cran Beaumont.”</p>

<p>“Really enjoyed it, Bob?” asked Mr. Ogden.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” answered Bob. “The
way the machine responds to every movement
of the driver is simply wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Taffy! Pile it on,” said Willie.</p>

<p>“May I go up now, Mr. Ogden?” asked
Cranny, his eyes flashing with anticipation.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I have time to take you all on
short spins.”</p>

<p>“Rah, rah!” yelled Cranny. “Watch now—see
if you ever met a fellow before who
could tether his bronc’ so fast.”</p>

<p>That morning, all but Willie Sloan took
their first ride in an aeroplane. Tom’s turn
came last; it was also the lowest and shortest
flight which Mr. Ogden had made. The boys
suspected the reason for this when the tall lad
was brought to earth once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“I fear something is the matter with our
Clifton,” remarked Willie, staring hard toward
him. “He seems to wobble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you wobble!” returned Tom,
threateningly.</p>

<p>“Gracious! Let me prescribe the rest cure
for an hour. Don’t go up again, if you come
down like that.”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid to try it yourself,” snapped
Tom, highly exasperated.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, our Mr. Clifton’s nerves are
so unstrung,” retorted Willie.</p>

<p>“Here, boys, lend me a hand,” interrupted
Mr. Ogden, with a smile. “We must put
the biplane under cover again.”</p>

<p>About two o’clock they all gathered in the
great square dining-room of the ranch-house.
Dinner was cooked and served by a young
Mexican who wore the picturesque costume of
his country.</p>

<p>The boys found the highly-spiced and tasty
dishes which he had prepared much to their
liking, and lingered a long time at the table.</p>

<p>“I suppose you intend to stay in this part
of the country for several weeks, boys?” remarked
Mr. Ogden, at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Yes, sir,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Have you any especial work that you intend
to do?”</p>

<p>“That one has,” said Willie, pointing his
finger at Cranny. “You wouldn’t think it, to
look at him, but he is going to be a rival of
Major Warfield Carroll.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes; an’ I’m here to see that he gets to
work. Mr. Beaumont thought he needed to
be roused up a bit, and sent him along with
the Ramblers and me. My, weren’t you gettin’
awful stale, though, Cran?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t make me yawn,” snapped
Cranny. “What were you going to say, Mr.
Ogden?”</p>

<p>“We—that is my sons and I—were wondering
if some of you lads could do us a great
favor?”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, the work out here is about completed,
and our presence is really required at
Border City. You see, there are still some
details to be arranged in connection with the
coming meet. Then, again, Major Carroll, who
is at work on a new engine, needs help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Ferd spoke up. “It would take us about
two weeks,” he said, “and, of course, during
that time our machines and stuff out here
would have to be guarded.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re just the boys to do it,” began
Cranny.</p>

<p>“The rest may be; but not you,” interrupted
Willie. “The idea, Cran! I’ll write
your father this very night.”</p>

<p>“Little busybody,” sniffed Tom.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clifton will think so when I get real
busy with him,” said Willie, with one of his
famous grins.</p>

<p>“You may count upon me, Mr. Ogden,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>And all but little Willie Sloan echoed his
sentiments.</p>

<p>“Why, it will be just dandy to bunk in
this old place for a week or two,” cried
Dick. “When shall you want us, Mr.
Ogden?”</p>

<p>“In a very few days. We certainly are
heartily obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Greatly in your debt, I’m sure,” said
Rob.</p>

<p>“And we’ll try to repay it,” added Ferd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>As they waited outside for Jed Warren to
appear, Willie Sloan began to express his
views on the subject.</p>

<p>“The idea of you fellows taking up a thing
like that!” he roared, in great disgust.
“Isn’t Circle T bad enough? And stay in
this old farmhouse for a week?—No, sir; not
for me.”</p>

<p>“He calls it a farmhouse!” scoffed Tom.</p>

<p>“And, besides, Cran Beaumont, you’ve got
to get to work—have to. Do you hear me
warble?”</p>

<p>“See here, Willie”—Cranny spoke in
soothing tones—“it’ll be no end o’ fun. I’ll
teach you how to ride a bronc’.”</p>

<p>“Ride a bronc’?” exclaimed Willie.</p>

<p>“Sure! You’ll find it the greatest sport in
the world.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to—I won’t, either.
Goodness, is that fat boy asleep?”</p>

<p>It looked suspiciously like it.</p>

<p>Dave was seated on the top step, with his
back resting comfortably against the door.</p>

<p>From the ancient stable came the steady
and monotonous buzzing of a gasoline motor,
while the stamping of bronchos tethered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the rear of the ranch-house could now and
then be heard.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Dave!” called out Bob.</p>

<p>“I feel like giving him a good shake.”
Willie looked almost as though he intended
to carry out such a proceeding. “He’s as
bad as Cran—needs enough ginger to stock a
grocery. You’re a bunch of softies—every
one o’ you. I won’t stay out here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to,” said Cranny.</p>

<p>“I will, hey? Then I’ll become a kid-puncher,
beginning with Mr. Clifton.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Jed, to take the little chap
back,” interrupted Tom. “Hello, Jed, old
boy!”</p>

<p>The cowboy galloped up.</p>

<p>“Hello, youngsters! Me an’ Pete saw that
there machine a-scootin’ around in the air.
Any o’ you lads have the nerve to try it?”</p>

<p>“Did we?—Well, I should rather say so—all
but this little chap here,” exclaimed Tom,
proudly, pointing to Willie.</p>

<p>“An’ I kin say they were sartingly a
bunch o’ pale ones when they kim down,”
said Willie.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame ’em,” grinned Jed. “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
little old pony for me, every time. Ready,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jed, old boy.”</p>

<p>While the horses were being hitched to
the buckboard the crowd raced to the shop
to say good-bye. They found the inventor
and his two sons busily engaged in testing a
motor for the “Ogden III.”</p>

<p>This biplane, Mr. Ogden explained, was a
great advance on the others. Conveniently
placed by the aviator’s seat was a stand to
hold charts, compass and other instruments.
An acetylene lamp also attracted Bob Somers’
attention.</p>

<p>“We have been thinking of making some
flights at night,” explained the inventor, in
answer to his inquiring look.</p>

<p>“I suppose you lads suffered great annoyance
in not being able to talk during the
flights,” remarked Rob, with a smile.
“This little arrangement allows the flyers
to converse to some extent with one another.”</p>

<p>“A speakin’ tube?” exclaimed Cranny.</p>

<p>“Or telephone—if you choose to call it so.
The science of aviation is constantly advancing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Later on, a means of communication
between aeroplanes in flight will probably
be devised. What’s that, Bob—you want to
take lessons in flying?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Just what I expected, Robert,” laughed
Mr. Ogden, Senior, with a quizzical look at
his son.</p>

<p>“I’m in on that scheme, too,” said Cranny,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“You didn’t come out here to do the eagle
act, Cran Beaumont. Your dad won’t stand
for it,” put in Willie.</p>

<p>“Listen to the little tot!” laughed Cranny.
“How about it, Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to consider the question,”
laughed the inventor, evasively. “Of course
when you lads come back there will be plenty
of opportunities to fly. If any show signs of
aptitude as bird-men, why——”</p>

<p>“We will be glad to give a course of lessons
to pay for your services in helping us
out,” broke in Ferd, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, what a lot o’ birdies I shall see,”
grinned Willie. “Say, this is a machine shop,
eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Did you think it was a dining-room?”
asked Tom, with great sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Looks as if every kind o’ tool that was
ever invented is here. What’s that thing at
the other end, mister?”</p>

<p>“All that remains of the ‘Ogden I,’ son,”
answered the aviator. “It has been dismantled
and some of the parts used for other
machines.”</p>

<p>The boys found the big workshop a very
interesting place. A soft mellow light from
the afternoon sun streamed in through several
open windows, lighting in its course a long
table upon which were placed various pieces
of machinery and a great collection of tools.
A large and a small glider rested against one
wall.</p>

<p>For once, Willie Sloan began to exhibit
some signs of interest. He wandered about,
poking his head into every corner of the shop,
until Jed Warren suddenly appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Time to git back, fellers!” he called.
“Comin’?”</p>

<p>“I reckon as how we be, pard,” answered
Willie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>As Bob shook the inventor’s hand, he said:
“The crowd will be back in a few days; and
then I hope to begin those lessons.”</p>

<p>Willie Sloan soon climbed into the buckboard,
the boys mounted their bronchos, and,
with a final shout and waving of hands to
the three aeroplanists, the crowd was off.</p>

<p>The buckboard, driven at a rattling pace
by Jed Warren, sent little eddies of dust
rolling behind it. In a short time the ranch-house
had disappeared behind a patch of
timber.</p>

<p>They were now in the midst of the herds of
cattle.</p>

<p>Willie Sloan firmly clutched the rail at his
side. Many misgivings once more rose within
him, as he studied their powerful bodies and
tremendous horns. Occasionally a bellowing
came over the air. Several times he saw
great steers pawing the ground and eying the
approaching vehicle with an air of defiance.</p>

<p>“Ginger! Wouldn’t it be awful if some o’
those ugly brutes should happen to bump
into us,” he thought. “Humph! Cran and
the others are getting away ahead.”</p>

<p>The sunlight was now enveloping the prairie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
in a golden glow, while the cattle sent long
purplish shadows over the ground.</p>

<p>“Have they lost you, Jed?” spoke up
Willie, suddenly.</p>

<p>Crack! The whip snapped and the buckboard
increased its speed, until Willie fairly
held his breath.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Warren—stop!” he commanded,
fiercely.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the driver’s grinning
face was turned toward him.</p>

<p>Willie doubled his little fist, and shook it
within an inch of the cow-puncher’s nose.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that again,” he cried, furiously.
“You wouldn’t know how to drive a cow to
market.”</p>

<p>“All right, sonny,” answered Jed, with apparent
meekness.</p>

<p>When the river was reached Jed followed
its willow-covered banks for some distance,
and, at length, forded the stream. Cranny,
Tim Lovell and the Ramblers were now but
tiny specks in the distance. Cattle still surrounded
them on all sides, and it was a great
relief to William Sloan when Circle T Ranch
finally came into view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>By the time they arrived, the boys were
lolling about the porch in careless ease.
Valdez, the dark-skinned Mexican, came
quickly forward and took charge of the buckboard
and horses, while Willie climbed wearily
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Where’s your hat, sonny?” asked Jed,
who noticed that his hair was blowing about
in the breeze.</p>

<p>“About five miles back on the prairie, I
guess.”</p>

<p>The boys on the porch began to roar.</p>

<p>“What became of it?” demanded Cranny.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice question to ask, when I just
told you. S’pose you mean how did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know you couldn’t help it,” returned
the other.</p>

<p>“That old thing on the driver’s seat made
those two poor nags nearly break their necks;
and the breeze was fierce. I had my hat on
the seat. It must have blown off when I
wasn’t looking.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Cranny. “That clears
you, all right.” He winked at Bob. “Honestly,
now, didn’t we have a bully time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Not enough to let you bully me into ever
going back,” growled Willie, shaking a cloud
of dust from his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Listen to the Insurrecto!” snickered
Tom.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a revolution around here soon,
Mr. Clifton, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>Willie stepped up on the porch and flung
himself down on a stool.</p>

<p>“Say, Cran, that workshop wasn’t half bad,
though,” he added, brightening up.</p>

<p>“Best I ever saw,” answered the big lad,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I guess it is the only one you ever saw.”</p>

<p>At the table, Bob Somers explained to Mr.
Follett their intention of making a stay at
Lone Pine.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, I should be sorry to lose you,”
said the ranchman. “Still, if it will be of
benefit to the Ogdens, I approve of your
plan.”</p>

<p>“Cran can’t go,” said Willie.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you might allow him a few days
of grace,” suggested Mr. Follett, with a smile.</p>

<p>For several days the boys enjoyed themselves
in various ways; that is, all but Willie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Sloan. He generally moped about on the
porch, gazing listlessly into space. Tim Lovell
had made a special effort to be friendly, only
to find himself rebuffed.</p>

<p>“I won’t go back to that old farmhouse,”
declared Willie, one evening, to Cranny.</p>

<p>The big lad pleaded and coaxed.</p>

<p>“Think of the fun you’ll have in that machine
shop,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“So I might—if those air-ship duffers
weren’t there,” said Willie, calmly. “Didn’t
I see ’em with a don’t-touch look in their eyes
all the time? Say, Cran, why couldn’t a fellow
fly to the moon in an air-ship—a balloon,
I mean?”</p>

<p>“Ask Major Carroll, when you make his
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“My! Your ignorance is something awful.”</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ to Lone Pine to-morrow,”
snapped Cranny, out of patience.</p>

<p>“Not I; I haven’t any hat.”</p>

<p>“If you never have another hat in your life,—it’s
Lone Pine for you to-morrow!” declared
Cranny.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>BOB TAKES A FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> Willie Sloan, in spite of his most vigorous
protests, did arrive early the next morning,
by means of the buckboard, at Lone Pine
Ranch.</p>

<p>A hat had been found for him, and, as its
original owner was a man of good size, the fit
was not all that could be desired. A piece of
newspaper stuffed into the lining, however,
prevented it from slipping over Willie’s ears.</p>

<p>“Here comes the Insurrecto,” grinned Tom,
as the conveyance rattled up.</p>

<p>Highly disgusted with everything and
everybody, Willie made no reply. He
promptly kicked a suit case off the buckboard,
then another.</p>

<p>“Here—one of those is mine!” roared
Tom.</p>

<p>“Come up and I’ll treat you the same way,”
snorted Willie. “How-de-do, Mr. Ogden?
Yes, quite well, sir, thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Quit throwing that stuff around,” ordered
Cranny, as suit case number three was about
to follow the others.</p>

<p>“I can’t find my knife anywhere,” growled
Willie—“must have dropped it among this
stuff.”</p>

<p>Several pairs of hands helped to unload the
vehicle, but the missing property was not discovered.</p>

<p>“That’s your fault, Cran Beaumont; if we
hadn’t come to this old farmhouse I’d
have——”</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and see the rooms, Willie,” interrupted
Dave Brandon, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Sure; no use lookin’ for that old ten-center;
it’s most likely lyin’ on the prairie
five miles from here,” said Cranny. “You’re
a careless kid.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” grumbled Willie,
scrambling to the ground.</p>

<p>The crowd followed the inventor and his
sons into the house.</p>

<p>“Go right up-stairs, boys,” said Mr. Ogden,
Senior. “Any rooms but the two on the eastern
side are at your disposal.”</p>

<p>Presently the lads were on the second floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
walking through the various apartments.
Some had queer-shaped recesses; others closets,
but without a vestige of their doors remaining.
The light which came in through
the dusty panes was not enough to dispel a
heavy air of gloom. A few pieces of furniture,
of a ponderous design, lifted themselves from
obscurity by sharp touches of light and dense
shadows.</p>

<p>“Oh, ginger! If this isn’t the worst ever!”
growled Willie, disgustedly. “Bet nobody’s
swung a broom in here since the year minus
one. An’ I see cobwebs, too!”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” snickered Tom.</p>

<p>“You’ll be howling for it soon. Say, does
that first-aid-to-the-injured book tell you what
to do for a good hard bump on the nose?”</p>

<p>The crimson mounted as far as Tommy’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Eh?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“When I catch you alone, Mr. Clifton,
volume two may come in handy. See here,
Cran Beaumont, I’ll tell you right now, I
won’t stay long in this old farmhouse.”</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the boys had discovered
that there wasn’t a bed in any of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
rooms, the only thing suggestive of comfortable
repose being a mattress placed on the
floor of the largest. What Willie said during
the next few minutes resulted in such a roar
of voices that Bob hastily stepped to the door
and closed it. Cranny did most of the laughing;
Tom was the angriest.</p>

<p>But eventually it all came to an end.
Willie had possession of the mattress, and
Bob agreed to make a desperate effort to secure
a pillow for him. Tim Lovell and
Cranny decided to share the room, and had
the privilege of taking any part of the floor
they chose.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows, let’s get to work,” cried Bob
Somers, briskly; “we’ll soon have these
rooms looking several years younger.”</p>

<p>With the exception of Dave and Willie, the
crowd set vigorously to work. They broomed,
scrubbed and dusted, until the long unoccupied
rooms began to assume a positively
cheerful appearance. Windows were thrown
open, admitting the pure, fresh air that swept
for miles over the prairie. By noon they
surveyed their work with much satisfaction.
Prints had been tacked on the walls; even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
some of Dave Brandon’s oil sketches were
hung up for critical eyes to examine.</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Willie, intently
gazing at a sunset. “Ever sell any?”</p>

<p>“Never did,” laughed the stout lad.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you could. What’s the
use o’ painting?”</p>

<p>“To inculcate a love and understanding of
nature in myself, and to help others in the same
way.”</p>

<p>“If a fellow ever saw a real sundown like
that he might think it was the end of the
world, and yell for help.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s simply immense!” cried Tom,
in amazement.</p>

<p>“Art critics often disagree,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>“The painting’s disagreed with me already,”
said Willie.</p>

<p>The boys all had a fine appetite for dinner;
and after it was over helped the inventor and
his sons to get out the “Ogden II.” Rob took
several of the lads on short flights, while
Willie spent his time in the workshop.</p>

<p>Bob again broached to Mr. Ogden, Senior,
the subject of taking lessons in the art of aviation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>The bird-man, disposed to be cautious,
again spoke of the risks, but finally agreed to
comply with his earnest request.</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t consent, Bob,” he explained,
“but for the fact that you seem to be
one who is not disposed to take foolish chances.”</p>

<p>“You can depend upon me, Mr. Ogden,”
cried Bob, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The days seemed to follow one another
swiftly at Lone Pine; and except during the
very hottest part of the afternoon the boys
always managed to find something to occupy
their attention. Ferd made many ascents,
taking Bob with him, rising higher on each
occasion, in order to accustom his pupil to
dizzy altitudes. Bob’s nerves, however, proved
equal to the task imposed upon them; and it
was agreed that soon he should be allowed to
occupy the aviator’s seat.</p>

<p>“Bob,” exclaimed Mr. Ogden, one morning
after breakfast, “would you like to take a
spin over to Border City?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“That ought to be a great trip,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Perfectly grand!” came from Dick, in
enthusiastic tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>With so many willing hands to draw the
aeroplane from beneath its canvas covering
the work was done in record time.</p>

<p>At length Bob clambered into his seat, his
eyes sparkling in pleasurable anticipation.
It was a fine day, with a lively breeze blowing
over the broad prairie. There was a fragrance
in the air—a scent of grass and other
growing things pleasant to the senses.</p>

<p>“So-long, fellows!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>Cheery shouts came in response. The
motor began to vibrate; the “Ogden II” shot
swiftly ahead, and, in another moment, yielding
to the effect of its powerful propellers, left
the ground.</p>

<p>Bob watched the objects skimming beneath
with ever-increasing speed. A backward
glance showed him Lone Pine and the boys
swiftly dropping behind. The horizon was
rising, each instant revealing greater stretches
of prairie. Chains of distant hills came into
view, and, far to the west, seen through a
whitish haze, the range of mountains extended
off in a series of jagged peaks.</p>

<p>The slight sensation of dizziness and feeling
of insecurity which Bob Somers had experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
during his early flights was now
almost entirely absent. He felt a strange
exhilaration as the cool air rushing by fanned
his cheeks.</p>

<p>Higher, still higher climbed the biplane
toward the white clouds above, through openings
in which streamed bursts of sunlight
that sent its shadow flying across prairie and
cattle. The yellow alkali plain, with its
curiously-shaped sandstone buttes, was soon
plainly in view, while he could see a line of
scrubby willows and a slender thread of bluish
white showing between, to mark the meandering
course of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden, having confidence in the nerves
of his passenger, soared still higher, the biplane
headed against a gently resisting breeze.
Occasionally as stronger or slanting gusts
struck the planes, it rocked; then, with almost
the buoyancy of a feather, recovered its
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Bob judged by the rapidity with which the
clouds were scudding past that the machine
was going at tremendous speed, but the earth,
so far below, seemed to be slipping by at only
a leisurely rate. He saw patches of timber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
enveloped in the deep blue of distance, acres
of tumbleweed, and vast areas of bright green
buffalo grass dotted here and there with cattle.</p>

<p>Far off, as little patches of white, Circle T
Ranch and its outbuildings presently shot
into view. Eagerly, Bob Somers watched it
growing larger.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Mr. Follett or any of the cow-punchers
see us,” he mused, drawing his field-glass
from its case.</p>

<p>A glance through it brought within the
range of his vision several tiny figures gathered
before the ranch, all apparently staring
hard at the flying machine.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden put on additional power. Then,
responding to a turn of its rudder, the aeroplane
cut a lane straight toward Circle T.</p>

<p>A few moments later they shot above it,
catching glimpses of figures moving about
with apparently sloth-like speed. Again Mr.
Ogden manipulated the rudder, and his biplane
swept around in a curve, while the
breeze, striking against it at an angle, sent
the planes tipping slightly.</p>

<p>Some distance ahead a series of partly-wooded
hills hemmed in the plain. Beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
these, in the midst of a dark, loam-covered
prairie, lay Border City.</p>

<p>Bob eagerly watched for its appearance.
He raised his field-glass again, bringing
within the circle of light rugged, barren
slopes or rich growths of spruce, aspen and
pine.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!”</p>

<p>Beyond their crests the glass had picked
out a collection of buildings extended for
some distance in a crooked line. When the
hills were beneath, Bob gazed upon the tops
of high trees, into ridges, bluish in shadow,
or at bald reddish rocks shining brightly as
the shafts of sunlight passed across.</p>

<p>Border City was looming up more clearly;
the cluster of light-colored houses seemed
rushing toward them. The changing perspective
brought first one building into
prominence, then another; but the hangar
of Major Carroll’s dirigible balloon and the
big gas tank easily dominated the scene.</p>

<p>Bob Somers, gazing earnestly through the
field-glass, saw the outlying buildings beginning
to detach themselves from the
general mass. Finally the crooked street of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Border City, far below, flashed suddenly past,
giving the two a momentary glimpse of excited
people rushing to and fro.</p>

<p>Then the town began to fall rapidly behind.
Mr. Ogden was piloting his machine directly
over the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>“Wonder where in the dickens he’s going?”
mused Bob.</p>

<p>The aviator changed his course, showing
perfect control, although the biplane tipped
to an apparently dangerous angle. When it
had righted itself, Bob found that they were
speeding swiftly back toward the city.</p>

<p>The roar of the engine suddenly ceased.
A pleasant calm, broken only by the soft
flutter of the breeze as it rushed by, followed.</p>

<p>They were volplaning straight toward the
hangar of Mr. Warfield Carroll’s dirigible
balloon.</p>

<p>The long glide through space brought
with it a truly delightful sense of comfort.
Bob Somers viewed the brown, loam-covered
prairie rushing toward them with almost a
feeling of regret. He could see groups of
people gathered about the hangar. Their
loud shouts of welcome, too, reached his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>The wind was singing past now at a faster
rate. Another pulsating roar began. Their
speed gradually slackened under the power of
the reversed propellers.</p>

<p>Calmness again; and a long, steady, breath-taking
swoop! There was a sudden change
in the slant of the balancing planes. A final
glide, then the biplane alighted on its wheels
with scarcely a jar, and stopped within a hundred
feet of the hangar.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE DIRIGIBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> navigators of the air were almost immediately
surrounded; but the man who
reached them first and extended his hand in
greeting toward that of Mr. Ogden was Major
Warfield Carroll, the New York financier.
He glanced with an expression of wonder
at the aviator’s passenger.</p>

<p>There was nothing very impressive about
Major Carroll’s appearance—not enough to
cause any one to take a second look. He
stood but little over five and a half feet high,
and was slight, with a closely-cropped sandy
mustache and gray-blue eyes. And it was
not until he spoke that a truer estimate of the
man could be had. His eyes then seemed to
fairly flash; his quick, nervous movements,
and short, jerky sentences, uttered in a voice
that vibrated with decision and energy, entirely
changed his appearance. Even the
most casual of observers could recognize in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
him a forceful character which nature had
somehow concealed from view in his physical
make-up.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Ogden,” he said, in
hearty tones. “Been expecting you all morning.
Your young friend, Bob Somers, eh?
Glad to see you, too. Never were up in an
aeroplane before, I suppose? What! Many
times? Well, well; an old hand at it, then!”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a few days old,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“Walters told me a short time ago that a
boy had telephoned from Circle T Ranch—wanted
to see our air-ship, I believe. Walters
is one of my mechanics. Were you the one?
No; but belong to a crowd that is over at the
ranch, eh? Everything working all right
with your new plane, Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Never better, Major Carroll. I think we
shall be able to capture several prizes.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. Now, Bob, if you would
like to examine the dirigible, come along.
Walters!” His voice rose in a loud call.
Then he added, quietly, “Ogden, I want to
consult with you on several matters, and the
aeroplane, or, rather, this crowd of inquisitive
visitors, may need a bit of watching.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>A man in blue overalls hove into view.</p>

<p>Leaving the mechanician in charge, the
three walked briskly toward the curious-looking
hangar. It was a wooden structure completely
covering the dirigible and closed at
the ends by canvas coverings. These, however,
were now drawn aside.</p>

<p>Two mechanicians were hard at work, as
the party entered.</p>

<p>“Great Scott; isn’t it a whopper!” cried
Bob, surveying the huge cigar-shaped hull
which loomed high above them.</p>

<p>“Air-ships very much larger have been
built,” said Major Carroll, “but this—the
‘Border City’ it is called—answers my purpose
sufficiently well.”</p>

<p>“Have you made any flights yet?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“A dozen, at least; and most of them satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“I can testify to that,” said Mr. Ogden.</p>

<p>“Perhaps a short description of the air-ship
may interest you,” added Major Carroll, “so,
while Mr. Ogden and myself are conferring
together, I’ll have Kindale—he’s my chief
mechanician—supply it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Bob thanked him.</p>

<p>“Yes siree; the ‘Border City’ flies like an
eagle,” said Kindale, a moment later. “How
long is the balloon? About a hundred an’
fifty feet. The diameter’s a bit less’n forty.
You see, like some rowboats, one end is
sharply pointed, an’ t’other’s round, so as to
give less resistance to the air.”</p>

<p>As the two walked slowly along by the side
of the huge air-ship Bob Somers marveled at
the knowledge and skill which had been able
to produce such a wonderful piece of work.
The long car, attached to the keel by wire
cables, was completely enclosed with rubber
cloth, having mica-covered windows at the
front and rear ends and an entrance in the
middle.</p>

<p>“The bag is made o’ several thicknesses
o’ rubber-coated fabric,” explained Kindale.
“Of course you know the whole thing ain’t
filled with gas?”</p>

<p>“I believe the bag is divided into compartments,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure; an’ the reason is this: cold, or air
pressure, contracts the gas, while heat, or lessening
of the air pressure, causes it to expand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Therefore, if we ascend to a very high altitude
the gas expands considerably; an’ supposin’
it’s on a blazin’ hot day—why, then
the envelope stands a good chance o’ bustin’,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” responded Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, one o’ the compartments is really a
little balloon inside the big one; an’ it’s kept
filled with air by a motor—just pressure
enough to balance the pressure of the gas
around it.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“An’ when the gas in the big envelope expands
it simply presses on the little balloon,
forces out some of the air through a valve,
and, in that way, gets room enough without
doin’ any damage.”</p>

<p>“A mighty slick scheme.”</p>

<p>“And when the gas contracts the motor
drives more air into the balloonette, which
fills out and keeps the big envelope inflated.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” remarked Bob. “It regulates
the pressure, so that they don’t have to
let the gas escape.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly! Of course, though,
we’re bound to lose some through leakage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
The framework o’ the car is made of light
steel tubing. In the middle is our gasoline
motor. These big screw propellers, just abreast
on either side, are worked by shafts. The
boss, if he happens to be in a good humor,
may let you go aboard.”</p>

<p>“I only hope he will,” said Bob. “Those
planes at the front and rear ends are to maintain
the vertical equilibrium, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Them big words don’t faze you, I see.
Yes; you’ve struck it. And the rudder, of
course, is at the rear. Wait a second; I’ll
speak to the boss.”</p>

<p>Kindale walked rapidly away, soon returning,
his face wearing a good-natured grin.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bob; he says you may climb
aboard. Be a little careful, for it ain’t like
gettin’ in an’ out of a Pullman.”</p>

<p>Bob followed the mechanician up a small
gangplank, and, stooping over, managed to
get inside the car. It was so dark that for a
few moments he was compelled to grope his
way, guided only by the movements of Kindale’s
shadowy form in advance.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be able to see,” remarked the
latter, cheerfully. “Don’t be skeered; there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
ain’t no holes to drop through. Kind o’ cozy,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” said Bob. “Must be
great to fly, and have all the comforts of
home.”</p>

<p>His conductor laughed, and proceeded to
raise several sections of the water-proof fabric
which enclosed the car. Bob saw that they
wound upon a series of rollers.</p>

<p>“The engine,” said Kindale, pointing it out.</p>

<p>“A fine one; and mighty powerful—I can
see that,” returned Bob.</p>

<p>“It is; beats the engine of your aeroplane
all hollow. In the rear we have a place to
store provisions an’ water. Come up front.”</p>

<p>Bob noted that everything about the car
was handsomely finished, even to several
seats ranged along the sides. A small table
stood near the steering gear at the forward
end.</p>

<p>The perfection of the “Border City’s” navigation
apparatus was also very apparent.
The highly polished surfaces of wheel, compass,
chronometer and levers caught and held
the rays of light which entered from the open
end of the hangar. Charts and a barometer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
were arranged in convenient places. A high-power
telescope was fastened to a stand close
by.</p>

<p>“It’s simply stunning!” cried Bob. “Not
a thing lacking, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“There certainly ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Go up or down easily?”</p>

<p>“Those levers you see operate a balancing
device patented by the Major. As the weight
shifts the air-ship is tilted, and the propellers
do the rest. Say, Bob, them air-skimmers ain’t
in it with this.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is more comfortable, and you
have protection from the weather,” returned
Bob, diplomatically.</p>

<p>“Sure! Why, it’s jim-dandy to stand here
steerin’, an’ look over the landscape. Only—the
Major don’t give us no rest. Sometimes
he gits ’bout seven ideas a minute; an’ jist
when we’re flyin’ good he’s apt to say, ‘Take
her right down, Kindale. The whole crowd
will have to hustle to-night.’”</p>

<p>“Then he is still working on it?” inquired
Bob.</p>

<p>“Still working on it! Why, man alive,
he’ll never git done tinkerin’ on it, the Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
won’t—no siree. An’ if he ain’t the first man
to cross the Atlantic in a balloon I miss my
guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish him luck. Mighty nice
man, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He can be,” grinned Kindale, shrugging
his shoulders. “No; the ‘Border City’ ain’t
goin’ up to-day—pretty soon, though. Say,
you had plenty o’ grit to go up in that skimmer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not so much—after the first time.”</p>

<p>“Talk about the nerve o’ them cowboys!
Why, they haven’t any. We’ve jollied them
a bit, but couldn’t even get one to say he’d
go up. They make me tired.”</p>

<p>“Their courage is of a different kind,”
laughed Bob. “Did some one call?”</p>

<p>“It’s the boss. All right, Major!” yelled
Kindale. “Oh, you’re welcome, Bob. It’s
easier talkin’ than workin’; I’d like to keep
it up. Comin’, Major. Wish to thunder he
wasn’t always in such an awful rush.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of the gangplank stood
Major Carroll and Mr. Ogden.</p>

<p>“How do you like it, young man?” asked
the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“It’s simply great,” answered Bob, enthusiastically.
“Never expected to see anything
half so fine.”</p>

<p>“Well, come over some day when we’re going
up, and I’ll take you along as a passenger.”
And, without waiting to hear Bob’s
thanks, he added, turning to his assistant,
“Kindale, I’ve got a new idea—a good one,
Mr. Ogden thinks. Come right along.”</p>

<p>Kindale, with something that sounded like
a deep sigh, thereupon walked abruptly away.</p>

<p>A couple of cow-punchers and numerous
residents of Border City were on hand to
watch Mr. Ogden and his passenger take their
places in the aeroplane.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go in that thing for a million
dollars,” said one of the former.</p>

<p>“Get out,” grinned Walters. “Before long
you’ll be steerin’ cows over the prairie by
aeroplane. Stand back, everybody!”</p>

<p>“I’m ready, Mr. Ogden. Good-bye, Walters!”
said Bob.</p>

<p>The sound of the motor blended in with a
volley of cheers from the crowd. The biplane
again soared aloft, and soon Border City was
left far behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>A noisy and enthusiastic welcome greeted
the navigators, as the machine gracefully volplaned
to earth and landed without accident
near the machine shop.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>“HE’S A PUZZLE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> afternoon, Bob Somers took his first
lesson in aerial navigation, his instructor being
Ferd Ogden. The aviator explained the
importance of learning how to volplane.</p>

<p>“You see, Bob,” he said, “in case of any
accident befalling the engine your safety may
depend upon landing at some particular point
on the ground, so the pupil must often make
attempts to alight within certain prescribed
limits.”</p>

<p>The two had just made a short flight,
and were standing near the ranch-house
in company with the other Ramblers and
Cranny.</p>

<p>“That’s a point I have often thought about,”
remarked the latter loftily.</p>

<p>“Very good,” laughed Ferd. “I suppose,
Bob, you have been trying to study the effects
of various air currents on the machine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And I guess Dave has already written a
treatise on the subject,” grinned Dick.</p>

<p>Bob Somers had found that with the aeroplane
under his own guidance, and every
movement, therefore, dependent upon the way
in which he manipulated the controlling
levers, the sensation was entirely different
from that of being merely a passenger. But
he quickly gained confidence, and on the succeeding
days gradually accustomed himself to
making short flights, always at low altitudes,
and with Ferd seated beside him.</p>

<p>“Nothing is apt to disturb one’s nerve so
much as a serious mishap at an early stage of
the proceedings,” Ferd remarked. “Go slow
is a good motto for the beginner.”</p>

<p>Whatever misgivings the inventor and his
sons may have had regarding Bob’s venture
into their chosen field soon vanished, for they
quickly realized that he was cool-headed and
not disposed to be venturesome.</p>

<p>Cranny Beaumont’s great ambition to become
an air-man, however, did not meet with
encouragement. Doctors and surgeons were
not plentiful around Border City, so the Ogdens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
firmly intimated that his talents might
be better turned into other channels.</p>

<p>“Cran” was disposed to sulk tremendously
at first, and Willie said a few things which
caused the Ogdens to keep close around, for
they were kind-hearted men and greatly preferred
that nothing should happen to him.
Ferd, then, good-naturedly humored the big
lad by taking him on several cross-country
flights, and every one was able to breathe a
little easier.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the time for the aviators to
leave was approaching. Each day had found
them hard at work in the machine shop, putting
the finishing touches on the “Ogden
III.” Bob and the others were often able to
assist, and in this way the lad gained a practical
knowledge of the biplane’s construction
and of the gasoline motor.</p>

<p>As Willie Sloan spent almost his entire time
in the shop, Bob Somers found many opportunities
to study him closely. Both he and
Dave Brandon became convinced that Mr.
Beaumont’s ward was a great deal sharper
than Cranny supposed. The latter never
failed to laugh at Willie’s odd questions, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the other two had a growing suspicion that
even those not intended to be humorous or
irritating were, as Bob expressed it, “Easy
offerings to an apparently easy crowd.”</p>

<p>“Hoodwinkers,” added Dave.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” roared Tom, upon hearing
these observations. “He’s so stupid that he
even doesn’t know how to act sensibly. His
thoughts wander, and every once in a while a
little puff escapes from the safety-valve. If it
wasn’t for that there would be an explosion
big enough to wreck the shop.”</p>

<p>Cranny roared again, and complimented
Tom on his wisdom.</p>

<p>“No use to try and draw him out,” complained
Dick. “He’s a puzzle to me.”</p>

<p>“I know,” laughed Bob. “But Willie
needs different treatment from most boys.”
Then, as Beaumont had walked away, he said,
in a lower tone: “Cranny couldn’t manage
him in a hundred years.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed how Willie acts in the
shop?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes; and if it wasn’t for Mr. Ogden and
his sons he’d be pokin’ his face into everything,”
said Dick. “They keep after him all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the time to keep him from meddling with
things.”</p>

<p>“And that disturbs Willie, too; it isn’t
necessary a bit.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” agreed Dave; “and I
rather think——” The stout boy paused.</p>

<p>“Think what?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That from the way Cranny and his father
talked Willie knew well enough they considered
him stupid.”</p>

<p>“And upon certain natures——”</p>

<p>“Such a course has a bad effect,” interrupted
Dave. “Encouragement does wonders;
tell a chap he’s doing well, and it often
spurs him on to greater efforts.”</p>

<p>“A little boost puts him on top of the
fence,” grinned Dick.</p>

<p>“Now, as Mr. Beaumont was good enough
to think we could liven up Willie Sloan, it’s
about time that something was done.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot in a boy finding out what
occupation he likes best,” said Bob, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Dave nodded.</p>

<p>“Willie certainly doesn’t seem to take any
interest in business, art or literature,” he remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
“but when he gets around machinery
I’ve often noticed a change in him—a great
change.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Let us try to find out if the lad has a
mechanical turn of mind.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! You talk like two real old
school-teachers,” grinned Dick.</p>

<p>“Wisdom and dignity go together.” Dave
laughed, as he added: “Here he comes now,
with Cranny.”</p>

<p>The big lad was pushing the little one in
through the doorway, apparently because the
latter didn’t move quite fast enough to suit
him.</p>

<p>“Say, Somers, what do you think?” began
Cranny; “Ferd says we may use the
‘Ogden II’ while they’re away at Border
City.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cran Beaumont,” squeaked Willie;
“you mean he said Bob Somers could.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s exactly the same thing.
Won’t it be bully?”</p>

<p>“Jolly!” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“And he says you’ve made good as an
aviator to a surprising degree,” added Willie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
“Don’t look pale under forty-three feet, I
suppose. Cranny couldn’t——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy enough,” grumbled Cranny.
“They must have some grudge against me. In
two lessons I’d have been soarin’ a mile high.”</p>

<p>“That’s an awful long distance to fall, isn’t
it, Doctor Clifton?” grinned Willie.</p>

<p>Tom stared hard, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“In a few days they are going to leave,”
said Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have to stay in this mean old
farmhouse all by ourselves,” grumbled Willie.
“See here, Cran, when will you get started on
your job?”</p>

<p>“In just a few days, Willie.”</p>

<p>“Gee! A nice business man Mr. Beaumont
sent out here. Mr. Ogden the First is
going to Border City to-morrow—says he’ll
take me along.”</p>

<p>“What! In the aeroplane?” cried Cranny,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Aeroplane nothing!”</p>

<p>“Afraid, eh?” grunted Tom.</p>

<p>“I saw the awful effect it had on Doctor
Clifton. My, what paleness! What wobbly
legs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Haven’t I gone up a lot of times?”
snapped Tom. “You needn’t talk.”</p>

<p>“He takes you only about twenty-eight
feet high. Yes, it’s true, Cran. I’m going
off in the wagon to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden, soon appearing, verified this
statement.</p>

<p>“Yes, boys,” he said; “some of our stuff
has to be hauled over to Border City.”</p>

<p>So, on the following morning, a vehicle
which had belonged to the former occupants
of Lone Pine was loaded with tools and
various parts of motors. Willie clambered
aboard; then Mr. Ogden took his place behind
a spirited pair of piebald ponies.</p>

<p>It was a blazing hot day, with only a few
clouds floating in the blue above. Scarcely a
breath of air seemed stirring to relieve the
oppressive atmosphere.</p>

<p>The crowd found the cool interior of the
ranch-house inviting, and soon gathered in
the big room down-stairs.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet when that little duffer gets back
he’ll have an awful grouch,” said Cranny.</p>

<p>“The worst ever, I s’pose,” came from Tom.</p>

<p>“He strings you a lot, eh, lad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Tom’s face darkened.</p>

<p>“But for you, Cranny, I’d have taught
him a lesson before this,” he exclaimed,
grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness!” snickered Cranny;
“that’s the second time. Fellows, form
an arbitration board, quick.”</p>

<p>“Some fireworks’ll start when Willie gets
back,” predicted Sam Randall.</p>

<p>Toward evening Mr. Beaumont’s ward, hot,
dusty and tired, returned. But the expected
“grouch” was lacking. Indeed, the boys
had never seen him in a better humor.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel well?” asked Cranny, with
apparent solicitude.</p>

<p>“Sure! Why, Cran?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing! What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Say, Cran, I saw the balloon that goes up
in the air.”</p>

<p>“You did? Why, that must be a new kind
o’ a balloon!” laughed Cranny.</p>

<p>“Major What’s-his-name took me all
through it.”</p>

<p>“An’ the gas didn’t even try to push you
out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit joking, Cran Beaumont. It’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
perfect whopper. An air-skimmer wouldn’t
look much bigger’n a mosquito, alongside of
it. And say, what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Major What’s-his-name asked me if I’d
like to go up some time; and I said, ‘You
bet! This thing is most large enough to take
a chap to the moon, isn’t it?’ You told me
to ask—remember, Cran? Then he made
this remark: ‘On my next visit to the
satellite I’ll take you along.’”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Say, Cran, isn’t it awful odd we didn’t
see in the papers that he’d been up to the
moon?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” came from Tom.</p>

<p>“What’s a satellite, Cran?”</p>

<p>“Get a book, and find out.”</p>

<p>“Ginger, but your ignorance is becoming
monotonous.”</p>

<p>“I declare, I’ve got to get a look at that
balloon, myself,” exclaimed Cranny, with a
great deal of emphasis. “To-morrow I’ll
take a business trip to Border City and look
over the field.”</p>

<p>“A business trip!” scoffed Willie. “Take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Doctor Clifton along. He’s tall enough to
look over several fields.”</p>

<p>“Who wants to go?” went on the big lad,
paying no attention to this flippancy.</p>

<p>“Count me in,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“And me, too,” chimed in Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>Accordingly, early on the following morning,
the three rode over to Border City. The
business part of Cranny’s trip consisted
mainly in making a close inspection of Major
Carroll’s dirigible balloon. Afterward, Cranny
and his friends rode straight to the Carroll
Inn, where the big lad wrote a letter to his
father. It was chiefly remarkable for the
lack of information it contained, and ended
with the surprising statement: “A lot more
facts in my next.”</p>

<p>“A few days at the ranch, an’ then I’ll
begin work in real earnest,” he announced to
his companions.</p>

<p>“If you don’t, Willie may get ahead of
you,” grinned Tim.</p>

<p>And this remark made Cranny laugh.</p>

<p>When the three reached Lone Pine again,
they found that Bob Somers had made his
first unaccompanied ascent in the “Ogden II.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“He’s almost a full-fledged aviator now,”
commented Ferd. “I’m very glad, boys, for
day after to-morrow we leave Lone Pine in
your care.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>WILLIE SHOWS HIS NERVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> “day after to-morrow” seemed to
come around very quickly, and, as is usually
the case when one is leaving for any length
of time, an immense number of things had
to be attended to at the last moment. It was
a busy morning for all, except, of course,
Willie Sloan and Dave. These two had a
natural aptitude for relieving themselves of
work.</p>

<p>When the wagon had finally been loaded,
the young Mexican hitched the horses to it,
and the inventor and his sons were at last
ready to bid a temporary good-bye to the
scene of their successful labors.</p>

<p>“Now, Bob, don’t forget, the workshop is
to be kept closed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden, Senior, spoke in a tone which,
while low, reached the ears of Willie Sloan.</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course, in case any occasion to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
tools arises, you have my permission to take
them. Now, may I rest assured that you will
exercise the same care in making flights as
before?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you may, sir!”</p>

<p>“That relieves my mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ginger; the workshop is to be kept
closed,” murmured Willie. “Isn’t that awful
luck?”</p>

<p>The smile which had rested on his face immediately
vanished.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, lads!” Mr. Ogden was calling.
“Yes, Bob; one of us will ride over soon.
Take care of yourselves.”</p>

<p>“We shall!” laughed Cranny.</p>

<p>A chorus of “Good-byes” arose. The
Mexican flapped his reins and the wagon
wheels began to revolve.</p>

<p>The crowd raced by the side of the vehicle as
far as the stockade, and stood gazing out over
the prairie as it rumbled slowly away. Not
until a patch of timber had hidden the conveyance
did they turn toward the ranch-house.</p>

<p>“All alone!” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Dreadful situation—with no one but
Willie to protect us,” wailed Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“See here, Cran Beaumont, when are you
going to get to work at Border City?” demanded
Willie.</p>

<p>“Mighty soon,” answered Cranny, with a
cheerful grin. “I’m thinking ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“And I guess that’s almost enough to give
you brain fag. Say, I do wish those cattle
would keep away from our yard. There’s an
awful lot loafing around outside. Ever notice
their eyes, Brandon? They roll frightfully.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done, fellows?” asked Tim
Lovell.</p>

<p>“Done?” cried Willie. “Why, there isn’t
a thing we can do, now, in this old farmhouse.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s certain that you can’t stay in
the machine shop poking into other people’s
business all day,” said Cranny.</p>

<p>“When I want advice I’ll go to some one
whom I can address as ‘Mister,’” returned
Willie, scornfully. “Going sky-planing to-day,
Somers?”</p>

<p>“It’s my turn to go up with Bob,” urged
Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he won’t drop the subject,
then,” said Willie. “Go on—an’ up. Do I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
ever intend to try it? No! Haven’t got the
nerve, eh? Say, Cran, what’s a mailed fist?”</p>

<p>“A letter, sometimes,” chuckled Cranny.</p>

<p>“Huh; not so dense, after all,” said Willie.
“If I were your dad, the mailed fist I’d send
would knock you flat on the prairie.”</p>

<p>The first thing the boys did was to take
stock of the provisions. Then they reached
an agreement regarding the cooking, as usual,
leaving Dave and Willie out of their calculations.</p>

<p>Later, Bob Somers, with Tim as his passenger,
made a short cross-country flight.</p>

<p>Willie, now unable to visit the machine
shop, fell quickly back into his old listless
ways.</p>

<p>After lunch, the boys, with the exception
of Dave, explored a subterranean passageway
which led from the house to the stable, and
found a great deal of fun and interest in the
proceeding.</p>

<p>The days began to pass with a somewhat
monotonous regularity. Early one morning,
when the “Ogden II” was ready for a flight,
Willie Sloan sauntered slowly into view. For
some time, the boys had observed him carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
around a small, red-covered book; but
even Cranny’s efforts to discover what it was
had met with failure.</p>

<p>Tommy, walking over toward the biplane
to take his seat beside Bob, saw the small
volume drop from Willie’s pocket, and instantly
made a grab toward it.</p>

<p>“Here—let that alone, Dr. Thomas Clifton!”
snapped Willie, in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>The crimson flush, which, ever since Tom
had grown so tall, came to his face on the
slightest pretext, was once more in evidence.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you getting so wild about?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Wild? I’ll get more’n wild. Don’t you
dare touch that book, smarty!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Where’s that arbitration board?”
roared Cranny.</p>

<p>But Tom already had the book.</p>

<p>“You open it—just you open it!” came
from Willie.</p>

<p>Tom Clifton’s forbearance was not equal to
the task of accepting this command with equanimity,
particularly as it was accompanied by
a threatening movement of Willie’s fist.</p>

<p>Deliberately, he turned the pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Why, it’s called ‘Practical Mechanics,’ fellows,”
he announced.</p>

<p>Willie instantly tore the book from his
grasp.</p>

<p>“You’ll catch it for that, you bean-stalk!”
he piped, furiously.</p>

<p>“Little grouch! Scary kid—afraid of
everything!” cried Tommy, highly incensed
and excited. “Afraid of bronchos! Afraid
of tame old cows! Afraid to go up in an
aeroplane!”</p>

<p>“I am, eh? I’ll show you how much afraid
I am, Doctor Clifton!”</p>

<p>To the astonishment of all, Willie deliberately
elbowed the tall lad aside and laboriously
climbed up by the side of Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“There’ll be the biggest muss anybody ever
heard of, if you try to put me off, Somers,” he
snapped.</p>

<p>“He’s only bluffing,” jeered Tommy.
“That’s my place, William; step down!”</p>

<p>“Come an’ take it, Mr. First-aid-to-the-injured,”
challenged Willie, doubling his fists.</p>

<p>“Stop jawing!” commanded Bob, his eyes
twinkling with amusement. “Do you really
wish to go, Willie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“If I don’t, nobody else shall,” said Mr.
Beaumont’s ward, with emphasis, as he stared
angrily at the grinning faces around.
“Afraid, am I? We’ll see, bean-stalk—bean——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” commanded Bob.</p>

<p>“I can wallop anybody who says that I’m
afraid,” screeched Willie.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” It was Cranny’s roar again.
“Who’d ever have believed it? The little
chap is actually beginning to show some signs
of spunk at last!”</p>

<p>“Now, Willie, do you still wish to go?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then let me fasten this strap about you.”</p>

<p>“Hold on tight,” said Cranny.</p>

<p>“Ready?” asked the aviator, a moment
later.</p>

<p>“Go on,” answered Willie.</p>

<p>“Give him a good ride, Bob. We’re goin’ to
saddle up an’ follow you,” called out Cranny.</p>

<p>“Ho for a canter over the rolling plain!”
cried Dick.</p>

<p>As several preliminary gasps came from the
motor, the boys dashed pell-mell toward a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
frame building in the rear, where their bronchos
were stabled.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II” was off.</p>

<p>Willie Sloan, clutching hold of the supports
for dear life, instantly began to regret his hasty
decision. The powerful engine was sending
them along at a rate which, to his inexperienced
eyes, seemed extremely dangerous.
And the earth was falling away from them in
a most curious and awe-inspiring manner.</p>

<p>The boy shut his eyes to keep from view
this dreadful sight.</p>

<p>After many minutes had passed, he again
dared to peer through half-opened lids. Although
they were flying quite low, that one
swift glance was enough to make his head
swim. But the thought of Tom Clifton prevented
the lad from reaching over to give
Bob Somers a warning touch on the arm.</p>

<p>“I just won’t let old Doc Cliffy have a
chance to grin at me,” he reflected.</p>

<p>He looked at the white fabric close around
him; then turned his eyes upward, to see a
translucent yellowish light shining through
the plane. He experienced an unpleasant
sensation of being suspended in space. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
bird flew by, so close that his eyes took in the
measured beating of a pair of wings. His
startled exclamation was drowned by the
steadily throbbing motor.</p>

<p>Bob, frequently glancing toward Willie,
finally read upon his face evident signs of distress,
and, considerately, decided that it was
time to bring his flight to a close.</p>

<p>He turned his gaze earthward, and saw a
shadow of the biplane skimming lightly across
green fields and herds of cattle. He would
have been glad to speak a reassuring word to
his passenger, but the din of engine and whirr
of propeller blades made this quite impossible.</p>

<p>“I can’t land anywhere about here,” he
thought, with another look at the herds of
longhorns just below.</p>

<p>Bob observed that the animals, frightened
by the monster of the air soaring not so high
above their heads, were already showing signs
of uneasiness. Some pawed the ground, or
ran about, while others, with uplifted heads,
stared defiantly toward them, as though ready
to engage in battle.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have to go higher; this might
start a stampede,” he reflected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Accordingly, Bob manipulated the control
levers, and the “Ogden II” began to climb
steadily upward.</p>

<p>Willie Sloan could not stand the sight of
the earth receding. He again closed his eyes,
and held on with a still tighter grip, as Bob
finally sent the biplane around in a great
curve.</p>

<p>The planes, naturally, began to tip.</p>

<p>Willie Sloan’s eyes shot open to their widest
extent. Bob had risen just a little higher
than his shaky nerves could stand. He stared
hard for an instant, and then:</p>

<p>“Go down, Somers; go down!” he yelled.</p>

<p>The aviator gathered the sense of his words,
and in his desire to ease the mind of his excited
passenger, sent the “Ogden II” again
rushing toward a lower level.</p>

<p>“The little chap ought not to have tried
it,” he reflected. “I’ll have to take my
chances on the cattle stampeding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p168">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“GO BACK TO THE RANCH”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And now a new fear had entered Willie
Sloan’s mind. He looked at the earth, apparently
coming toward them with appalling
speed; he thought that Bob Somers had misunderstood
him and intended to make an
effort to alight somewhere on the plain below.
He looked at the dreaded steers, now in a state
of great commotion.</p>

<p>“No—no! Go back to the ranch, Somers!”
he yelled, hoping that his words might be
heard.</p>

<p>In his anxiety, he reached over and gave
the aviator’s arm a violent jerk.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate move, at a critical
moment. Instead of soaring off in a horizontal
direction, in response to a clever handling
of the control levers at the proper instant,
as Bob had counted upon, the interference
so affected his manipulation that the
biplane continued on its downward course.</p>

<p>Hastily, he attempted to undo the result of
Willie’s imprudent action. It was a moment
such as may happen in any aviator’s career,
when a false move may send the machine
crashing like a broken-winged bird to the
ground.</p>

<p>With the engine in reverse, and their momentum
only slightly checked, the biplane
shot straight toward a rise in the prairie.
Another instant, and they would be upon it.
All Bob Somers hoped for was to prevent the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
machine from smashing against the ground
with dangerous violence.</p>

<p>But Willie Sloan was even more frightened
than ever. A glance at Bob Somers’ knit
forehead and firm-set lips gave him no encouragement.
A dreadful vision of being
held fast with plunging longhorns on every
side caused him to reach down and unfasten
the leather strap which stretched across the
seat. Then he partly rose to his feet.</p>

<p>It was his second blunder, and, like the
first, had a most disastrous effect. Several
straggling steers were wildly attempting to
race out of the biplane’s path, and, in spite of
Bob’s quick effort to prevent it, one swinging
directly beneath was struck a glancing blow
by the descending ’plane. Willie Sloan,
partly off his balance, became, the next instant,
completely so. He began to topple—a
sharp cry came from his lips—he was falling.</p>

<p>The little red book, the innocent cause
of this startling incident, slipped from his
pocket, to strike an unappreciative steer in
the eye, while Willie himself dropped squarely
upon the back of another.</p>

<p>Wildly he threw out his hands, and grasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
with all his might an immense pair of
horns.</p>

<p>Five seconds later, Mr. Beaumont’s ward,
still clinging desperately to his novel steed,
was being carried away from the scene of the
accident.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>MILLING THE HERD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Willie Sloan made his unfortunate
move, it took the six boys riding on the prairie
but a moment to realize that something
was wrong with the flying machine.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dick Travers, look at that!” called
Cranny Beaumont to the nearest rider.</p>

<p>Dick’s eyes were already staring hard
toward the “Ogden II.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott; there’s something up!” he
cried, putting spurs to his broncho.</p>

<p>“And there’ll be somethin’ down mighty
soon, I’m thinkin’!” answered Cranny. “If
those boys ever get caught among a herd of
stampedin’ steers——”</p>

<p>“They’ll be in the worst fix of their young
lives,” Dick flung excitedly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Riding at a rattling clip among the cattle
wasn’t easy work. The animals, frightened
by the huge object flying above their heads,
were beginning to bellow and paw the ground.
The sight of their wild eyes and excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
movements, so suggestive of a headlong dash
across the prairie, might have given even veteran
cowboys a feeling of uneasiness.</p>

<p>But all the lads, from different points on the
prairie, unhesitatingly urged their horses into
a gallop; and, as they swung along, various
currents of longhorns were sent eddying out
of their paths.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get to the biplane, and
swing the cows around it!” yelled Cranny
Beaumont.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II” was rushing swiftly
toward the earth, and he could hear the steady
hum of its motor rising above the clatter of
his horse’s hoofs. The big lad was now in
his element; his eyes flashed with excitement
and determination. Skilfully he guided his
horse between the longhorns, sometimes finding
a great hulking body lumbering along at
his side. Cranny realized that any instant
the living barriers which shut him off from
the open plain might begin an irresistible
rush. Dick Travers was riding just ahead.</p>

<p>Cranny, anxious to be the first on the
scene, threw his whole energy into the
task, and within a few minutes, he had overtaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and was slowly forging ahead of his
nearest rival.</p>

<p>As the “Ogden II” approached the ground
the commotion among the animals rapidly increased;
they were scattering wildly in all
directions, threatening at every instant to collide
with the bronchos.</p>

<p>But, to Cranny’s relief, he could see over
the tops of moving bodies that the biplane
was dropping upon a point comparatively free
from cattle.</p>

<p>“We can swerve ’em off easily,” he thought.
“Great Cæsar!”</p>

<p>Cranny stood up in his stirrups, and gave a
shrill whistle of astonishment. He had just
been a witness to Willie Sloan’s extraordinary
mishap. Another whistle—this time of real
alarm—escaped his lips, as he saw his father’s
ward land on the back of the steer.</p>

<p>“Jupiter!” he yelled, excitedly.</p>

<p>He gave a glance toward the biplane settling
down upon the ground, but even that one
swift look was enough to show him the aviator
jumping unharmed from his seat.</p>

<p>“Stand by Bob Somers, fellows!” he yelled.
“I’ll go after Willie Sloan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>The alighting of the “Ogden II” in the
midst of the cattle immediately brought about
the result which every one had feared. The
gaps in the herd began closing up. Cranny
Beaumont found the forward progress of his
broncho almost checked—a tide of panic-stricken
steers was forcing him off toward one
side.</p>

<p>The lad fought hard; his tough rawhide
continued to slash right and left. Stinging
blows upon huge, unwieldy bodies drove them
out of his path, and, presently, made an opening
through which his snorting broncho
plunged.</p>

<p>The clouds of dust were becoming thicker;
Willie Sloan, desperately holding on to the
horns of the steer, was already half obscured.</p>

<p>As Cranny thought of the great danger
which threatened the lad, a sudden pallor
came over his face. With so many cattle to
bar his progress, the task of overtaking Willie
seemed almost impossible.</p>

<p>“And I’m away ahead of the others!” said
Cranny, aloud.</p>

<p>He again stood up in his stirrups, to look
over a scene of wild confusion. A great herd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
of steers, now in almost a compact mass, was
sweeping over the plain, forcing his broncho
along as irresistibly as a chip is carried on the
surface of a running stream. A din of pounding
hoofs was in the air, while, at times, deep-throated
bellowings rose above it.</p>

<p>Through a haze of whirling particles,
Cranny managed to catch another glimpse of
Willie; and the sight nerved him to make
one more desperate effort to force a passage
through the living mass around him.</p>

<p>Some distance off, a lone cow-puncher had
turned, and was galloping swiftly toward the
oncoming cattle. This grizzled veteran of the
range, whose keen vision had enabled him to
instantly grasp the situation, knew that quick
action was necessary.</p>

<p>As his brown-patched pony approached the
foremost steers, he uttered a series of lusty
yells. He was too old a hand to get caught
in the resistless torrent of moving bodies.
Single-handed, he was attempting to “mill”
the herd, or swing the foremost cattle around,
so as to slow up and finally stop those following
in the rear.</p>

<p>Sam Randall and Dick Travers, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
managed to reach the outer edge of the herd,
came galloping up to reinforce him.</p>

<p>“Pete Sanderson!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>“He’s the boy who can do it!” yelled Dick.
“Come on!”</p>

<p>“I’m a-swingin’ ’em, boys!” called out
Pete. He ended his sentence with another
wild yell.</p>

<p>The boys saw the tide beginning to turn.</p>

<p>“As I live, here comes Cranny!” shouted
Dick.</p>

<p>Looming up through the yellow dust,
Cranny Beaumont, hot, hoarse and perspiring,
could be seen riding straight toward
them.</p>

<p>“Rah, rah! Don’t let up a second, fellows,”
he cried. An instant later he yelled:</p>

<p>“Whoop—look at this!”</p>

<p>Above the noise they became conscious of
a loud hum. Almost as swift as an eagle’s
flight, the “Ogden II,” after having made a
wide circuit, was rushing toward them. A
purplish shadow flitted across the backs of
the herd.</p>

<p>“Bob Somers!” shouted Cranny, hoarsely.</p>

<p>There was no need for Pete Sanderson or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the boys to put forth any further efforts.
The biplane, skimming low, was completing
the work which the cow-puncher had begun.</p>

<p>The tired cattle were sent swinging off at a
sharp angle, with Sanderson and his allies
close behind them.</p>

<p>Pete’s eyes roved anxiously over the mass
of moving backs. It was the first possible
chance they had had of reaching Mr. Beaumont’s
ward.</p>

<p>Never before in Cranny’s life had he experienced
such mingled feelings of fear and
dread. Every moment visions of Willie
Sloan losing his hold and being trampled
underfoot were passing through his mind.</p>

<p>“I see him; I see him!” he yelled, at
length, in joyous tones. “Look, Dick!”</p>

<p>Dick Travers’ quick glance took in the
small form of Willie Sloan. He saw him still
clinging to the back of the animal, which
was jammed in the mass some distance away.</p>

<p>Most of the steers were now moving over
the plain at a slow walk.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon git him out o’ thar!” declared
Pete, vigorously.</p>

<p>Tim Lovell, who had finally succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
fighting his way through the cattle, came galloping
up.</p>

<p>“Hooray for the brave little chap!” he
cried. “Rah, rah! Yes, Dick; Tom’s all
right. I saw him a few moments ago. Want
any help, Pete?”</p>

<p>“Ye’d best leave it all to me, boys,” commanded
the cow-puncher.</p>

<p>He was going about his task in a thorough
and systematic manner. One by one, steers
were separated from the general mass, then
driven aside in small bunches, until, at last,
one particular longhorn was able to move
freely about.</p>

<p>Pete was alongside of him in an instant;
his brawny arm encircled the form of Willie
Sloan, and, while Cranny and the others
yelled long and heartily, he lifted the lad from
his position and set him gently on the
ground.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Didn’t</span> I tell ye it weren’t nateral ter fly?
Didn’t I say ’tweren’t never intended?”</p>

<p>Straight-backed Pete Sanderson, standing
with his hand on the bridle of his broncho,
glared severely at the group of boys. Little
Willie Sloan sat on the turf, while Cranny
had taken a place close beside him.</p>

<p>“’Tweren’t never intended,” repeated Sanderson,
in decided tones; “an’ I reckon ye’ll
believe me now. It’s a positive wonder none
o’ you younkers didn’t git killed in that stampede.
Sure ye ain’t hurt none?”</p>

<p>“I was pretty near jolted into a jelly,”
grumbled Willie, who, after a half hour’s
rest, was beginning to recover his composure.
“An’ say—perhaps I didn’t have a hard time
holding on to that old codger’s tusks!”</p>

<p>“You did wonders,” said Cranny, heartily.
“Bet you were scared stiff, eh?”</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t have been? Whew! It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
was simply awful. Seemed as if there was
about a million of the brutes behind me.
Guess Somers has gone back to the farmhouse
in his old bird-plane. I thought the thing
was going to get smashed to bits.”</p>

<p>“Bob hovered overhead until he saw we
were all safe,” said Dick. “Wasn’t it bully,
the way he helped mill the longhorns?
What made him come down in such an all-fired
rush, Willie?”</p>

<p>“Somers couldn’t fly a kite,” growled Mr.
Beaumont’s ward, non-committally. “It was
all Mr. Clifton’s fault. Goodness gracious—it’s
gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone?—What’s gone?” demanded Cranny.</p>

<p>“Oh, if that isn’t the awfulest—meanest
luck!” Willie clapped his hand frantically
to each of his pockets in turn, then jumped to
his feet and looked hastily on the ground.
“Sure as you look like a simpering idiot, Cran
Beaumont, it’s gone!”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Why, that little red-covered book.”
Willie seemed almost on the point of blubbering.
“I had it in this left-hand pocket.
Look around, you chaps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>The chaps did as requested, but, naturally,
without result. The little red-covered book was
lying, a shapeless mass, fully a half mile away.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I couldn’t paste old Doctor Clifton
for this!” roared Willie, highly exasperated.
“It’s all his fault.”</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one, to talk like that, after
the way we dived right in among the longhorns
to help you,” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“But I want my book,” wailed Willie. “It
was such a dandy. Ginger—if I don’t get
square with you for this, Mr. First-aid-to-the-injured!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me worse and worse tired!”
scoffed Tom.</p>

<p>“Come on right now—if you aren’t afraid.”
Willie, with a flourish of his fists, began to
dance around. “I’ll make you more tired,”
he howled. “I’ll punch you for every page in
that book.”</p>

<p>“Quick, fellows—get the arbitration board
to working,” laughed Cranny. “Let’s have
the treaty signed.”</p>

<p>And at that instant Willie Sloan aimed a
right hand uppercut at Tom’s chin, which, as
the tall lad straightened up, fell short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“He’s scared to scrap,” howled Willie.
“Get out of the way, Brandon, or I’ll hurt
you, too.”</p>

<p>A roar of merriment followed these words.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can laugh,” jeered the small boy,
“but I’m not going to put up with any more
funny business from Bean-stalk. That book
cost somebody twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, I’ve got to git around the
range,” broke in Pete. “Now don’t forgit
what I told ye—leave them thar arioplanes
alone; d’ye hear? ’Tain’t nateral ter fly;
an’, what’s more, ’tweren’t never intended.
An’ ye’d best tote yerselves over to the ranch-house
afore the young un cleans up the
bunch. It wouldn’t take much, nuther, ter
git these hyar longhorns goin’ ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Only hope you’ll punch some of ’em good
an’ plenty for me,” piped Willie. “Take a
squint at Mr. Clifton, Sanderson—see him
before and after.”</p>

<p>The cow-puncher guffawed loudly, sprang
into the saddle, and, with a wave of his hand,
galloped away.</p>

<p>Willie positively refused to mount behind
any of the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Never—nix!” he said. “To-night, Doc
Clifton, you’ll be jolly well surprised.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?” sniffed Tom.</p>

<p>“You will!”</p>

<p>While they were still some distance from
Lone Pine, Bob Somers rode out to meet them.
He was more than delighted at the fortunate
outcome of the exciting adventure, and, in
answer to Dick Travers’ eager question about
the biplane, told the crowd that beyond a
slight injury to one of its propellers the machine
had escaped injury. He laughingly
parried the questions which were fired toward
him as to the reason for the strange behavior
of the “Ogden II.” So the boys, having a
strong suspicion of the truth, finally desisted.</p>

<p>Once again in the ranch-house, they set to
work, and were soon busily engaged in the
disposal of a cold lunch.</p>

<p>Willie, during the course of the meal, sat
hunched up in his chair, and occasionally
answered questions in monosyllables, but took
no active part in the conversation. Finally
he slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>“Don’t wonder he feels a little grouchy,”
remarked Beaumont, when he presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
noticed his absence. “Say, I never supposed
the little chap had so much spunk—showed
a lot o’ courage to-day, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that boy,” said Dave,
decidedly.</p>

<p>“Lot’s of impudence, for one thing,” murmured
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Tom!” laughed Dave; “be
generous—broad-minded. Why, he may surprise
us some day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be surprised if he surprises us,” grinned
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t. If you have ever
studied the lives of famous men——”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious, David Brandon, can
you imagine for a second that William Sloan
will ever become a great man?” cried Dick,
his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“Dave’s cold meal has given him a nightmare
while he’s still awake,” roared Tom.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must admit having been
squelched again,” sighed the fat boy. “Made
a mistake in not yielding to that sleepy
feeling the instant I took the last bite.
And I am more than uncommonly drowsy,
so——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“We all know what that means,” laughed
Bob.</p>

<p>The boys soon went up to their rooms,
some to add a few lines to letters already
partly written, others to read.</p>

<p>To their surprise, Willie Sloan was nowhere
to be found.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, and he did not
appear, Cranny began to look annoyed, then
anxious. He walked to the window and threw
it open.</p>

<p>“Hello, Willie!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Where in the world can the little chap
be?” he remarked, after several of the others
had called.</p>

<p>“Search me,” quoth Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>“A search all around might be better,” said
Dick, dryly. “Perhaps he’s taking a Marathon
out on the prairie.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” scoffed Tom. “He’s
too scary for that.”</p>

<p>All but Dave soon left the building in quest
of Mr. Beaumont’s ward. At the stockade
they stopped to shout long and earnestly, but,
as before, no answering hail was borne on the
gentle breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Depend upon it, he’s up to some funny
business,” hinted Tom.</p>

<p>“I declare, I’m beginnin’ to get worried
about him.” Cranny leaned against the wall,
and looked searchingly over the vast expanse
of plain. “What do you think,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“That he may be in the house—somewhere
down-stairs.”</p>

<p>“But after all this screeching he would
have come out.”</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well look.”</p>

<p>It was rather dark in the big room, so Bob
lighted one of the swinging lamps which hung
over a center table.</p>

<p>“Of course he isn’t anywhere in here,” said
Cranny.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ search proved the truth of
this assertion.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s that?” cried Sam, suddenly.
He stooped to pick up a piece of brown wrapping
paper which lay near the open fireplace.
“Why, it has some writing on it.” Sam’s
eyebrows were arched in surprise.</p>

<p>“Goodness! bring it over to the light,”
cried Tom, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>Sam obeyed; all, including Dave, who had
just entered the room, crowded closely around
him.</p>

<p>They read, written in a large, scrawling
hand:</p>

<p>“Extra! Look for the white trail. Search
the underground passageway for the truth.”</p>

<p>“Search the underground passageway!”
cried Dick, wonderingly. “What in the
mischief does that mean?”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a mystery, all right,” murmured
Cranny.</p>

<p>“And, to clear it, we’d better light a lantern
and search,” suggested Dave.</p>

<p>His advice was acted upon. Crowding at
Bob Somers’ heels, the now highly interested
and mystified boys followed him toward a
room at the western end of the house, where
a stairway led down to the cellar.</p>

<p>“Hello—look!” cried Tommy. “That
must be the trail.”</p>

<p>They could see bits of white paper scattered
about, forming an irregular line that led to
the doorway.</p>

<p>“What silly kind of joke is this, I
wonder?” growled Tim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Follow the trail and find out,” said Sam,
in a sepulchral whisper.</p>

<p>The stairs were old and rickety; the walls
streaked with cobwebs. Every footstep echoed
in a most uncanny fashion, and sent up eddies
of dust, as the boards sprung beneath their
heavy tread, while a smell of damp, mouldy
earth assailed their nostrils.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Isn’t this dismal?” remarked Tim
Lovell.</p>

<p>“Twice over the limit—you can imagine
what that means,” grunted Cranny. “Just
wait till I see that funny kid.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of the steps, Bob Somers
paused. His swinging lantern sent weird
streaks of light through the blackness.
Beams traveled rapidly over rough, scarred
walls, or brought into view piles of rubbish.</p>

<p>A trail of paper led across the hard earthen
floor.</p>

<p>“Forward, march! Fall into that awful
black spot across the cellar—it’s the underground
passageway,” cried Dick.</p>

<p>“Watch yourselves, fellows,” cautioned
Tom. “William may be up to some mischief.
Great Scott! What was that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Only a badly scared rat,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll dent him some if he comes this way,”
declared Sam.</p>

<p>Their voices and footfalls echoed weirdly
through the dungeon-like cellar.</p>

<p>“What a nerve he had, to come down here
alone,” said Tom, awesomely.</p>

<p>“I told you there was something in that
lad,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>“But most of it ought to be beaten out with
a flat piece of board,” returned Dick.</p>

<p>They came to an abrupt stop at the entrance
to the passageway. Bob, holding his lantern
aloft, sent its rays flashing upon musty walls,
thickly festooned in places with cobwebs.</p>

<p>“Whew! It’s kind o’ unearthly in there,”
said Cranny, peering over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I should say rather too earthly, Cranny,”
grinned Bob.</p>

<p>“This is enough to smother a fellow, too,”
added Tom, with a sniff of disgust.</p>

<p>“Follow the trail anyway,” cried Dick
Travers, who was rapidly becoming impatient.</p>

<p>They fell in behind Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“Maybe Willie is going to shut us in, as a
joke,” remarked Tom, in sudden alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“How—you tall goose?” sniffed Sam.</p>

<p>“Hello—there it is!”</p>

<p>“Where—where?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>Bob Somers’ hand fell upon a large piece of
cardboard covered with writing. It rested
upon a projecting stone.</p>

<p>“Right here, fellows,” he announced,
calmly.</p>

action suggested. Can he write? Paint?
No!</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Isn’t it hot out in the moonlight?</p>

<p>“Mush is soft; and so are—but what’s the
use?</p>

<p>“P. S. The mailed fist! It’s coming. If
Cran isn’t recalled when Mr. Beaumont gets
my letter it will be a wonder. The combination
of Mr. Clifton, Lone Pine and longhorns
has been too much—I have flown. Do
not look for me. Your detective abilities are
not equal to unraveling this mystery. Brain
fag is bad.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours, before the get-away,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">William Brinton Sloan</span>, P. G. S.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Great Scott!” howled Cranny. “My, but
wouldn’t I like to punch that little duffer!”</p>

<p>“And just wait till I meet him,” added
Tom, his eyes fixed on the dash which came
after his name.</p>

<p>“And to think,” mused Cranny, “that we
dropped down to the center of the earth to get
such a knock as this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“An average kid!” groaned Dick, looking
around.</p>

<p>“Suspected it yourself, I guess,” observed
Cranny. And, while the echoes of boisterous
laughter were reverberating, both Dick and
Sam could be seen standing silently and
solemnly a little apart from the group.</p>

<p>“Average!” repeated Sam, with a sudden
thought. “I suppose he means an average of
ninety-five or over, same as we generally get
at school.”</p>

<p>“And my artistic status has at last been
established,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>The boys stared hard into each other’s
faces for a moment, then the last angry
expression vanished, and roars of merriment
again thundered through the passageway.</p>

<p>“My name isn’t on the list,” murmured
Tim. “Can’t make out whether he let me
down easy, or handed over a dreadful slur—ignored
me entirely, you know.”</p>

<p>They followed Bob Somers back into the
cellar, and then up-stairs, breathing the sweet-scented
air which came in through an open
window with sighs of relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“I’m bothered!” howled Cranny. “Where
could the boy have gone?”</p>

<p>“Not out on the prairie alone,” declared
Tom.</p>

<p>“He’ll be back at grub time,” predicted
Dick.</p>

<p>“Nervy little scamp, after all,” mused
Cranny, his face now wearing a terrible
frown. “I wonder if he really did write to
dad. He could have given the letter to one
of the cowboys.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he has,” said Tom, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You chaps get something to eat while
Sam and I take a look around,” suggested
Dick, with an innocent expression.</p>

<p>“Well, did you ever!” roared Tom, indignantly.
“Why, it’s your turn to cook.”</p>

<p>This sad fact was duly impressed upon Dick
Travers’ mind by Cranny, who seized him by
the collar and forcibly directed his steps
toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>During the preparation of the meal, the
others scouted in various directions, going
far beyond the stockade walls. A faint glimmer
of daylight still lingered on a high bank
of clouds in the east; the silent plains would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
soon be bathed in the pale rays of the moon,
now a trifle less than half full. Shadowy
groups of cattle were browsing amidst the
buffalo grass, or contentedly resting.</p>

<p>Not a sign of Willie Sloan anywhere!
That was the report of each scouting party.</p>

<p>The swinging lamps above the table threw
a glare of light over highly disturbed countenances.
It did not seem possible that Mr.
Beaumont’s ward could actually have had the
courage to run away; but as time rolled on,
the boys were obliged to reluctantly reach
this conclusion.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Tim.</p>

<p>“Telephone to Circle T; perhaps he went
back there,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>Cranny Beaumont, acting upon this suggestion,
soon learned that neither Mr. Follett nor
any of his men had seen Willie Sloan.</p>

<p>“My, but this does make me tired,” sniffed
Cranny. “Now Mr. Follett is all worked up
about it.”</p>

<p>“By this time to-morrow we’ll probably
have Willie with us again.” Dave spoke in
consoling tones.</p>

<p>“We certainly can’t do another thing to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
that chap to-night,” said Sam. “Let’s make
the best of it. Bet he’s just hiding somewhere.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine night for taking observations of
the stars,” remarked Dave. “Suppose we
carry the telescope up on the roof?”</p>

<p>“Good scheme,” approved Bob.</p>

<p>Thereupon they ascended to the second floor,
in a few moments reaching a storeroom,
where a ladder rested against a trap-door.
The stout boy was active enough when it came
to doing anything he particularly cared about,
so it took him but a short time to get the telescope
and stand in position on the roof.</p>

<p>In pointing the tube from one star to another,
or over the almost limitless expanse of
nature, and picking out from the obscurity
groups of longhorns or clumps of trees, the
boys were able to partly ease their minds.</p>

<p>For about an hour they kept it up, then,
one by one, descended to their rooms, where
before long all were sound asleep.</p>

<p>Tom Clifton finally awoke with a start.</p>

<p>The sound of a bell, ringing crisp and sharp,
came to his ears. Tom hastily threw aside his
blankets and rose to a sitting position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Goodness gracious!” he breathed excitedly.
“It’s the ’phone down-stairs, sure
enough!”</p>

<p>The summons, singularly clear, in the
dense silence of the night, was ringing continuously.</p>

<p>“Bob!” cried Tom, scrambling to his feet—“I
say, Bob!”</p>

<p>Bob Somers opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Eh, Tom?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear that bell?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should rather say so.”</p>

<p>The big room looked weird and dismal,
with the greenish moonlight streaking across
the rough board flooring and showing in
queer-shaped patches on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>Bob listened intently, as he jumped up,
struck a match, and proceeded to light the
lantern.</p>

<p>“Mighty odd, Tom—unless it’s about
Willie,” he said. “No; don’t awaken Dave.”</p>

<p>The two tiptoed down-stairs, Tom feeling
decidedly creepy sensations coursing along
his spine.</p>

<p>The bell, which had stopped for an instant,
started up afresh as they entered the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Bob Somers made a dash toward the instrument,
and took the receiver from the
hook.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” he called, in anxious
tones.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” came an answer. “Ha,
ha!”</p>

<p>It was a familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Willie—Willie Sloan!” cried Bob.
“Where in the dickens are you, Willie?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Did you fellows get my note,
Somers?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes!”</p>

<p>“Which one was the maddest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit that, Willie. Tell me where you
are.”</p>

<p>“In a corkin’ nice room. But you wouldn’t
like it—hasn’t got a single cobweb; can’t
write your name on the dust, either.
Say——”</p>

<p>“Are you actually at Border City?” broke
in Bob.</p>

<p>A squeaky laugh came distinctly over the
wire.</p>

<p>“Got the best in the Carroll Inn. Oh, but
don’t I feel sorry for you poor chaps? How is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Lone Pine, an’ longhorns? Do you believe in
the recall of Cran Beaumont? What’s the
Referendum, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Did you walk all the way across the plain,
Willie?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Every time I thought of Mr. Clifton
it made me jump ten feet. Ha, ha! Has
he grown any since I left?”</p>

<p>“We’re coming over after you to-morrow,
Willie.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t get William Brinton Sloan,
P. G. S. I declare war.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try our arbitration board, then,”
laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“Won’t do a bit of good.”</p>

<p>Just as Bob began to speak again, a peculiar
buzzing sound came over the wire. It was
broken by a jumble of words and occasional
little crackles, and his energetic calls brought
forth no response.</p>

<p>“Bill has evidently hung up the receiver,”
remarked Bob; “he has said enough and cut
us off sharp; we are probably being laughed at.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that chap the queerest ever!”
cried Tom. “Why, he must have a bit of
courage, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Plenty of it,” smiled Bob. “It’s a big
relief to know the lad’s all right. Who
would ever have thought he’d do a trick like
that?”</p>

<p>“Not I, for one. Won’t Cranny and the
others be surprised?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather. No, Tom; we won’t wake
’em up—the news will keep. Queer they
didn’t hear that bell.”</p>

<p>The two, talking in low tones, climbed softly
up-stairs and into their room. Then, wrapping
themselves in their blankets, they were
soon unconscious of either time or place.</p>

<p>In the morning, the news created a great
sensation.</p>

<p>“Amazing!” was the word which followed
a long-drawn-out whistle from Cranny.</p>

<p>Dick looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe it,” he murmured.
“Willie seemed so all-fired afraid of those
longhorns.”</p>

<p>“Well, he did it, anyway—actually walked
across the plains.”</p>

<p>“I’m the I-told-you-so fellow,” laughed
Dave. “Knew there was a lot in him.”</p>

<p>Cranny reflected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Fellows,” he presently observed, “we
ought to teach him a jolly good lesson.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Why, he has only a few dollars; let him
alone for several days, an’ he’ll wake up an’
be beggin’ us to trot over an’ get him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that.” Dave shook
his head. “He’s really a brave little chap.”</p>

<p>Cranny began pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, “I’ll have to get busy
soon, or else the ‘mailed fist’ may be something
more than a joke.” He laughed dryly.
“But I want to have a bit o’ fun first. Let
me manage this affair.”</p>

<p>And the others agreed.</p>

<p>An hour later, Bob took his place on the
“Ogden II,” and, with Cranny Beaumont as
his passenger, started off. By this time, all
but Dave had saddled their bronchos and
were ready for a canter across the plains.</p>

<p>The stout boy waved his hand to the
horsemen, then waited until the biplane had
soared far off.</p>

<p>“I’ll do a bit of reading first,” he reflected,
“and afterward take a squint through the
telescope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>So Dave ambled back into the house,
selected a book, settled himself in the most
comfortable chair, and prepared for unalloyed
pleasure.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the telephone bell
rang sharply.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I can’t rest even a second,”
grumbled Dave.</p>

<p>He lumbered slowly over, and answered the
summons.</p>

<p>“Is that Lone Pine Ranch?” came in a
crisp, businesslike voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“This is Major Warfield Carroll.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! What can I do for you, Major
Carroll?”</p>

<p>“I want to relieve your mind of any anxiety
regarding Willie Sloan.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad indeed to hear that.”</p>

<p>“He has been with me at the hangar all
morning. I can tell you he’s a bright lad—something
quite remarkable. I only hope,
however, that it may not be a week or more
before I can find some of my tools—he’s quite
interested, you know.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Dave, in surprise. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
feeling quite sure that the Major was delivering
himself of a gentle sarcasm, he began to
smile broadly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Follett knows that he is here, so you
boys needn’t bother about him for a while.
Now, is Doctor Clifton there? You’re in his
charge, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Dave nearly fell backward from the telephone.</p>

<p>“The little scamp!” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” came from the receiver;
“I don’t seem able to catch your answers
very clearly. Please tell the Doctor not to
worry about the lad’s absence.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” answered Dave, whose
smile was rapidly becoming broader.</p>

<p>“He intends to send you a letter by one of
the cow-punchers. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Odd—odd—odd!” reflected Dave. “Now,
is there another grand old rumpus coming—or
what? Guess the Major hasn’t learned to
wear a ‘don’t-touch’ look, like the Ogdens.
Quite a surprise, this.”</p>

<p>Dave picked up his book, reseated himself,
and, with his feet comfortably disposed on a
stool, began to read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>A pleasant breeze came in through a
window close by; sometimes the lowing of
a distant longhorn was borne to his ears;
but otherwise the silence seemed oppressive.
Conditions were ideal for lulling the stout lad
into a blissful slumber.</p>

<p>Dave promptly capitulated, and the book
dropped from his hand.</p>

<p>When he once more sat up, it was only because
two boys, talking in a lively fashion,
had entered the room.</p>

<p>“Caught you at it again,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly had an uncommonly
fine nap,” admitted Dave, with a yawn.
“Have a nice trip, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t we!” cried Cranny. “It was certainly
a corker. The ‘Ogden II’ sailed just
like a bird. Hey! Something to tell us,
Dave? What is it?”</p>

<p>Dave explained.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha—ho, ho! That Major’s a smart
chap, all right,” laughed Cranny. “Sized up
the kid already! Willie a bright lad! Ho,
ho! Anyway, it’s bully news. I’ll stay here
for about three days longer.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you really make a landing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Border City? I had an idea you would come
back and tell me all about things.”</p>

<p>“We sailed right over top o’ the big Noah’s
ark, but I wasn’t going to do anything that
might spoil those great three days,” said
Cranny. “Besides, we saw a lot of little
specks on the ground, and made up our minds
that the smallest was Willie.”</p>

<p>“You’re a grand guardian,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>Within a short time, the steady, rhythmic
sound of hoof-beats floated into the room—the
others were returning. It didn’t take
them long to stable their bronchos and race
inside.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Major Carroll ’phoned you—says
William is with him?” cried Tom, in
astonishment. “The nerve of him!—I mean
William, of course.”</p>

<p>“I’m tired of Willie as a subject of steady
conversation,” growled Cranny.</p>

<p>“Forget him for a few days—do, please,”
suggested Tim.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it three,” said Cran.</p>

<p>The only other event of interest that day
was a short visit from big Sam Skillet, foreman
of Circle T Ranch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“This here b’ilin’ weather ain’t a-goin’ ter
last much longer, youngsters,” he announced,
in his tremendous voice, as he was about to
leave.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a weather eye, I s’pose,”
grinned Cranny.</p>

<p>“I sartinly have; an’ it’s always open.
So-long!”</p>

<p>Sam’s prediction proved to be correct.
Toward evening the sky was entirely covered
with grayish clouds, while a strong breeze
blew over the great stretch of rolling prairie.</p>

<p>On the following day, as the threatening
weather continued, Bob Somers decided to test
his skill as an aviator under more difficult
and trying conditions by making one short
flight, with Tim Lovell as a passenger.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of work that needs a steady
hand, Dave,” he said, on landing, “but I
have the hang of the thing pretty well, now.”</p>

<p>“I believe you could manage the ‘Ogden
II’ in a hurricane,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>Several days later, while all were seated
around the breakfast table, the ring of the
telephone broke in upon their conversation.
Bob Somers sprang to answer it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>The boys immediately noted by the sound
of his voice that he seemed considerably surprised.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Cranny.</p>

<p>Bob turned his head away from the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>“There’s a pretty stiff breeze blowing, eh,
fellows?” was his unexpected question.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes! Why?” cried Dick.</p>

<p>Bob, without replying, hastily turned to
the instrument again.</p>

<p>“All right, sir; we’ll keep a sharp lookout,
and ’phone you if we see it,” he said. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Tim Lovell, animatedly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden ’phoned from the hangar at
Border City that Major Carroll has made an
ascent in his dirigible.”</p>

<p>“He’s done that before,” exclaimed Dave,
wondering at Bob’s expression. “Is anything
the matter?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden fears there is something wrong
with the air-ship,” answered Bob.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE TWO IN THE SKY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Something</span> wrong with the air-ship!”
echoed Cranny Beaumont, in the greatest astonishment.</p>

<p>“How—in what way?” asked Dick, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Give me a chance, fellows. Mr. Ogden
says Major Carroll intended to stay up for only
a short time. He was testing a new steering
gear. The balloon, after making several
turns, began to sail away, apparently unmanageable.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” Tim Lovell stared at the
others. “The wind’s just from the direction
of Border City. It must be coming this
way.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get busy, fellows,” cried Bob, briskly.
“We’ll run out the ‘Ogden II.’”</p>

<p>“Why—what’s the use?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Because they may need us to stand by
’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“But you wouldn’t dare to try it in a
breeze like this!”</p>

<p>“Of course I should—if necessary. It isn’t
much worse than yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to skip up on the roof,” said
Dave. “May be able to sight the ‘Border
City.’ I’ll take the telescope with me.”</p>

<p>While Bob, followed by several of the
others, dashed out of the room, Dave Brandon,
with Cranny at his heels, started up-stairs.</p>

<p>Cranny, presently, banged open the trap-door,
then, reaching down, took from the
stout boy’s hands the telescope and stand.</p>

<p>“I see it—I see it!” he yelled, before Dave
Brandon had even time to put his head and
shoulders through the opening, “and it’s
sure coming this way.”</p>

<p>Dave clambered out upon the gently-sloping
roof.</p>

<p>Coming from the direction of Border City
was a cigar-shaped object, clearly defined
against a gloomy expanse of clouds. The air-ship
seemed sailing straight before the wind,
and this, Dave Brandon calculated, would
allow it to pass within half a mile of the
ranch-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“It looks to me as though Mr. Ogden were
right,” commented Dave, as he got the instrument
into position, while Cranny braced the
stand.</p>

<p>“Hurry up; let me get a squint,” pleaded
the other.</p>

<p>Dave put his eye to the telescope.</p>

<p>Space instantly seemed to be annihilated;
the great air-ship loomed up grim and majestic,
sailing apparently close at hand, its planes
and rudder shining brightly against a threatening
sky. At the forward end two figures
were dimly visible behind one of the mica-covered
windows.</p>

<p>The impressive sight held Dave Brandon
in its grip. Here and there, steel tubing or
wire rope caught a gleam of light, while upon
the top of the great yellowish gas-bag was
reflected a grayish hue from the heavy clouds
above.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer, moving with measured
precision, came the “Border City.”</p>

<p>Dave drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“It’s headed straight for the mountains,
Cranny,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do they want to get bumped against some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
high peak? Why in the world doesn’t Major
Carroll come down?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he isn’t willing to let any of the
gas escape.”</p>

<p>“And the propellers aren’t working. Guess
that explains it—something wrong with the
engine.”</p>

<p>“Say, shall I have to drag you away?”</p>

<p>Dave yielded his place.</p>

<p>“My, but isn’t it sailing along, though!”
burst out Cranny. “There goes some ballast
overboard.”</p>

<p>“Trying to find a favorable current of air,
I suppose,” said Dave.</p>

<p>From below came the sound of voices. The
“Ogden II” was being hauled from under
its tent and made ready for a flight in record
time.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tim’s head appeared above the
trap-door.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Didn’t think I’d see it so
close as all that,” he said, climbing up. “Isn’t
it a great sight, eh? Give me a chance at that,
Cranny.”</p>

<p>The observer was exhibiting unmistakable
signs of excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Yes, sir; as I live, it’s true!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Tim, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Well, well! If it isn’t a fact, just let me
know.”</p>

<p>Cranny, with a look expressive of the greatest
astonishment, stepped aside, while Dick
took his place.</p>

<p>By this time the “Border City,” flying high,
was almost abreast of Lone Pine.</p>

<p>As Dick Travers looked through the telescope,
every detail of the great air-ship flashed
into view with wonderful distinctness.</p>

<p>But it was upon two figures standing by
the now open window that Dick concentrated
his entire attention. An exclamation escaped
him. There was no mistaking the smaller
one of the two, whose face, framed in by a
square of dark, seemed to be staring hard
toward them.</p>

<p>“It’s Willie Sloan!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Willie Sloan!” echoed Dave, in startled
tones.</p>

<p>“Sure! I guess the other must be Major
Warfield Carroll himself. And both of them
seem to be trying to signal us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“I spotted Willie in a moment,” explained
Cranny. “Gee! I don’t like this a little bit.
If the balloon is ever carried over to the
mountains——”</p>

<p>The big lad’s sentence ended in a whistle.</p>

<p>“And you can just bet that’s where she’s
bound,” declared Tim. “This wind is rising
steadily. Hurry up, Bob,” he yelled, “or
you’ll be too late!”</p>

<p>His voice carried to the busy worker below,
but it was some moments before Bob Somers
scrambled hastily upon the roof, with the
other eager and excited lads following him
closely.</p>

<p>Each received the news with some characteristic
expression of astonishment.</p>

<p>“William aboard that air-ship!” cried Tom,
almost incredulously.</p>

<p>“That’s where he is, son.” Cranny’s voice
and manner betrayed a disturbed spirit.</p>

<p>Bob Somers had his eye to the instrument.</p>

<p>“Yes, fellows; I can see Major Carroll
plainly,” he exclaimed. “He’s looking this
way through a field-glass. There isn’t a bit
of doubt in my mind that he has lost control
of the air-ship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Think he will try to clear the mountains?”
queried Dave.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be better than attempting
to land in such a wind as this?” Bob suggested.
“The Major doesn’t look scared—bet
he knows what he’s doing.”</p>

<p>“But suppose that when they do have to
come down, it’s in some mountain gorge?”
cried Dick. “They may end up by getting
lost; and, perhaps, with scarcely a bite to
eat.”</p>

<p>“Or—or—somethin’ worse’n that—if the
balloon doesn’t rise high enough to clear the
mountain tops!” came from Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>For a few moments, each, in turn, studied
the now retreating air-ship through the glass.
The magic of the telescope seemed to draw
the cigar-shaped craft toward them, until it
appeared as if but a tantalizingly short distance
away.</p>

<p>“It looks as if they only had to yell, an’
we could hear ’em,” said Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the details began to lose
their crispness and become merged in the
general mass.</p>

<p>As the balloon drew steadily away, the boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
all realized that in another hour the airmen
might be facing an unpleasant, if not dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>“My, how I do hope that they can make a
safe landing,” said Cranny.</p>

<p>“I’m going to chase them, anyway,” added
Bob. “Who wants to go along?”</p>

<p>A chorus of “Ayes!” was the immediate
response.</p>

<p>“What’s the use, though, Bob?” queried
Tom. “You can’t lasso the ‘Border City,’
like a longhorn, and tow her back.”</p>

<p>“No! But there’s no telling what may
happen. We can, at least, see where they
land, and be ready to lend assistance, if
possible.”</p>

<p>“It may be a case of plucking wee Willie
and Major Carroll from a perch in the trees,”
murmured Cranny.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>They had soon gathered around the “Ogden
II,” while the aviator made a final examination
so as to be sure that everything was in
working order.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows,” he announced. “Now,
whoever is going to make the trip with me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
must understand that it will be a mighty
risky job.”</p>

<p>Dave Brandon’s round face had quite lost
its accustomed cheery expression.</p>

<p>“I should say so, Bob. Perhaps——”</p>

<p>Bob, anticipating the rest of the sentence,
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Can’t back out now, Dave,” he said,
firmly. Then, springing aboard the biplane,
he fastened the strap which held him to his
seat.</p>

<p>A wordy warfare as to whom should be his
passenger arose. Cranny speedily settled it
by pushing the others away, and taking his
place beside Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“I dare anybody to put me off!” he
challenged.</p>

<p>“All right for you!” growled Dick Travers.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want little Dick, ‘average kid’
number one, to run into any danger,” grinned
Cranny. “Yes, Bob, I’m ready. All right,
Dave, we’ll be careful. Let her rip!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to ’phone Mr. Ogden, and
tell him we’ve started after the ‘Border City,’”
called the aviator.</p>

<p>His hands rested on the levers. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
a moment of suppressed excitement. Then
the engine began its steady roar, accompanied
by a loud whirr from the propeller.</p>

<p>As the biplane began to respond, a salvo of
cheers and good wishes arose. The “Ogden
II” had started on its dangerous voyage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE RESCUE PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Low</span>, scudding clouds were sailing fast
across the sky; but the current of air, blowing
in an uninterrupted course for miles upon
miles across the open prairie, was comparatively
steady. This gave the boys who remained
behind some encouragement.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon and Tim Lovell went back
upon the roof of the ranch-house, where they
studied the movements of the balloon and
aeroplane until the telescope no longer possessed
the power to separate either from the
gray background of sky and mountains.</p>

<p>The crowd had no intention of remaining
inactive. Only a dash across the prairie in
search of their friends could relieve their impatience
and pent-up anxiety. The boys below,
having saddled the bronchos, finally
yelled for the stout historian and Tim to come
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>But before the summons was obeyed the
sound of the telephone bell sent Dick Travers
in leaps and bounds toward the house.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he was presently calling.</p>

<p>“Is that Lone Pine Ranch?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“It’s only me, pard.” Dick recognized Jed
Warren’s voice. “Who’s that a-talkin’?”</p>

<p>“Travers! Where are you, Jed?”</p>

<p>“Out on the range—two mile away, at Mr.
Follett’s sub-station. ’Tain’t much more’n a
pile o’ boards throw’d together an’ a-standin’
on posts; but it’s got a door an’ a winder, an’
a roof ter keep out ther rain.”</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed Dick, impatiently.
“But what do you want, Jed?”</p>

<p>“I seen them thar air-skimmers a-kitin’ off
ter beat all creation; an’ I know everythin’
weren’t all right. How ’bout it, Dick?”</p>

<p>The lad explained.</p>

<p>“I thought so! An’ a-goin’ ter chase ’em,
eh? Wal, I don’t blame ye for feelin’ kind
o’ worked up. But ye’d best not wenture in
them mountains alone. Say, pard, I’ll meet
ye at Roarin’ Horse Junction. ’Member the
place?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Sure thing, Jed. When the crowd was
here before, we passed it.”</p>

<p>“Good! I’ve got a letter from that thar
little maverick over to Border City.”</p>

<p>“Willie Sloan?”</p>

<p>“The identical chap, pard. An’ I only
hope he don’t come to no harm in that skimmer.
Now, don’t forgit, Travers; wait for
me at Roarin’ Horse.”</p>

<p>Dick promised, and dashed away to tell his
friends.</p>

<p>“That’s great!” cried Tom. “Let’s get
right off.” He vaulted into the saddle, while
Dick raised his voice in another command to
Dave and Tim.</p>

<p>The two boys came hurrying forward, and
they all started immediately.</p>

<p>It was a long ride to Roaring Horse Junction,
so the boys allowed their bronchos to set
their own pace.</p>

<p>At the rendezvous, they found not only
Jed, but Pete Sanderson, as well. The young
cow-puncher had encountered the veteran on
the range, and Straight-backed Pete needed
no urging to accompany him.</p>

<p>Guided by the cowboys, who were thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
familiar with the trails, the party
crossed the foot-hills, and at length reached
the bolder elevations.</p>

<p>Here they traveled from one point of vantage
to another, spending several hours in this
way; but no trace of either aeroplane or balloon
could be discovered.</p>

<p>In the midst of a forest on the sloping side
of a mountain their bronchos were picketed,
for night was coming on. A strong wind
moaned and whistled through the trees, and
toyed with the pine cones, and sent little
eddies of dry leaves scurrying over the
ground.</p>

<p>“The balloon seemed to come about in this
direction,” declared Dave, who had taken his
seat on a partly decayed log.</p>

<p>“I only hope them thar fellers an’ the
ones in the arioplane ain’t been busted inter
a thousand bits,” said Pete. “But didn’t I
tell ye it weren’t never intended for men ter
fly?” The big cow-puncher glared sternly
from one to the other; and, as only gloomy
silence followed his words, began again:
“’Tain’t nateral; an’ only a bloomin’ maverick
’ud think as how it were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p222">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p222.jpg" alt="WHAT IN THE WORLD HAS BECOME OF THEM?">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“WHAT IN THE WORLD HAS BECOME OF THEM?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I do wonder what in the world has become
of them,” wailed Tom.</p>

<p>“Ye sartinly couldn’t expect ter round
them thar chaps up to onct,” said Jed.
“They might be a-sittin’ snug an’ comfortable
on t’ other side o’ a ridge, for all we
know—eh, Pete?”</p>

<p>The big cow-puncher, not disposed to take
so cheerful a view of the situation, evaded
this question.</p>

<p>“We’d best git a fire goin’, boys,” he said,
“an’ cook some grub.”</p>

<p>Pete looked up at the sky showing between
the dark, waving branches of the pines and
saw a procession of low clouds scudding
across.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve got a weather eye as
good as Skillet’s, eh, Pete?” said Cranny.</p>

<p>“I ’low there’s sure goin’ ter be a change
soon, younker,” answered the cowboy, indirectly.
“I kin see signs o’ its breakin’
a’ready.”</p>

<p>“If the moon would only be obliging
enough to come out, we could keep right on
searching,” remarked Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>“Maybe it will, arter while. Git to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
hustlin’, lads. A bite o’ grub won’t do nobody
a bit o’ harm.”</p>

<p>Even Dave Brandon skirmished around,
and soon the sound of hatchets hacking and
chopping away echoed through the darkening
forest. A pleasant scent of pine and other
vegetation was borne on the wind, which
rushed along with scarcely a lull in its monotonous
chanting. A great part of Dave’s
much prized and comfortable seat was reduced
to kindling wood while the stout boy
was away gathering brush.</p>

<p>Behind the shelter of a moss-covered
boulder, Pete Sanderson started a fire, while
several of the others opened saddle-bags, and
from their capacious depths took bacon,
crackers and cheese, and great quantities of
corn-pones.</p>

<p>Jed Warren assumed the duties of chef,
with none wishing to dispute his authority.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to loll about and sniff an
appetizing odor of things cooking, and to
see the big coffee-pot fiercely fuming and
sputtering on a bed of hot coals. But the
lads did not feel in any humor to enjoy it.</p>

<p>The fire threw out a ruddy glow, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
minute picking from obscurity the stamping
bronchos, and the next dropping them back
into gloom.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t have a chance to read the
letter from Willie that Jed brought,” remarked
Cranny, suddenly. “Guess I’ll do
it now.”</p>

<p>“I only hope he’s safe somewhere,” murmured
Tom. “That little chap has some
mighty good points in him.”</p>

<p>“I reckon as how he’s found out by this
time that it ain’t nateral ter fly,” said Pete,
straightening his tall, gaunt form. “How
many times hev I told ye it weren’t never
intended?”</p>

<p>“Something less’n a thousand, I guess,”
mumbled Cranny, holding Willie’s missive
up to the light.</p>

<p>“Read it,” said Tim Lovell, eagerly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Cran</span>:—” began the big lad:<br>
</p>

<p>“I have been thinking an awful lot about
you and the old farmhouse. With all your
broncho riding, and sky-planing, and mixing
in the society of longhorns, it does seem to
me, sometimes, that old Doctor Clifton will
get a chance at you yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Walters said that you and a couple of chaps
came over to the hangar one day, and that
you looked and talked just the nerviest ever—honest
fact, Cran.</p>

<p>“I explained that nerve cultivation is your
specialty; and Walters said: ‘His success is
something wonderful.’ It’s true, Cran.</p>

<p>“I’m having lots of fun here. Major Carroll
isn’t like the Ogdens; he’s one of the finest
men in the world, and has the greatest collection
of tools you ever saw.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Lots of fun!” broke in Dick, with a puzzled
look. “Perhaps, by this time, the Major
thinks we have escaped from somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Willie Sloan is evidently beginning to
find himself,” remarked Dave, quietly.</p>

<p>“And I wish to thunder we could find Willie
Sloan,” said Cranny. He began to read again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He doesn’t put up an awful holler just
because I touch a bit of scrap iron, and, once in
a while, bust something. Say, Cran, did you
know that they put gas in balloons?—It’s a fact.</p>

<p>“Major Carroll is going to take me up soon.
Those old Ogden air-skimmers are not in it
with a ship like Major Carroll’s. I guess one
doesn’t feel as if he was sitting in a sieve, with
the bottom likely to drop out any minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“I told you I was going to write to my guardian,
Cran; and it’s done—fact. Say, that letter
is enough to blister the air, or burn the postman’s
hands. It ought to make a sensation.”</p>
</div>

<p>The firelight flickering over Cranny’s face
showed a sadly disturbed expression.</p>

<p>“Odd kid!” he commented, “eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Awfully odd,” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>“An original,” drawled Dave.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Major Carroll says he’ll be glad to meet

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Crickets, that’s a funny letter, all right,”
declared Tim Lovell, as Cranny finished reading.</p>

<p>“I should say more than funny,” added
Tom. “Wonder what P. G. S. stands for?”</p>

<p>“G—goose; S!—what does S mean?”
came from Sam Randall.</p>

<p>“What does P mean?” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Maybe it ought to be P. S. G.—Pretty
Slow Goose,” suggested Tom, suddenly recalling
the shafts of sarcasm with which Willie
had bombarded him on numerous occasions.
Then, relenting, he added, “But, after all,
he’s a rather nice little kid.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” admitted Cranny.</p>

<p>A little later, they sat down to supper, and,
in spite of their troubled state of mind, managed
to dispose of every scrap.</p>

<p>“Oh, but don’t I wish the weather was
better,” said Dick, when the meal was over.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll be able to scout around a
bit, after all,” Pete assured them. “The
moon is beginning to light up the clouds.”</p>

<p>The cow-puncher’s observation was true; a
faint silvery sheen soon became sufficiently
strong for the waving tree tops to be outlined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
against it. Above the steady roar of the
wind were heard weird snapping sounds, as
branches occasionally fell, or grated against
their neighbors; and the soft patter of leaves
was broken by rustling noises strangely suggestive
of footsteps coming and going amidst
the brush.</p>

<p>But the boys had long since become accustomed
to the mysteries of the night, and paid
no heed. Perhaps eyes belonging to wild inhabitants
of the forest may have been, at
times, intently fixed upon them, as they sat
about. The flames rose higher, sending a
flickering glare far into the depths.</p>

<p>“Clearing, at last!” cried Dick, whose
patience had been sorely tried by the long
wait.</p>

<p>“There’s a big hole in the clouds, sure as I
live,” said Sam, exultingly.</p>

<p>“Then the scouting can begin mighty
soon,” added Tom.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Pete Sanderson gave
the order to start, and, after beating out every
vestige of the fire, the boys sprang into the
saddle.</p>

<p>A shadowy group of horsemen, led by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
cow-punchers, picked their way slowly between
the trees. It was still very obscure,
but occasionally a silvery beam penetrated the
darkness and streaked over the ground.</p>

<p>For several hours, the determined riders
kept up a steady march. At times, they were
turned aside by impenetrable thickets, at
others, obliged to pass through dark and forbidding
ravines, with beetling cliffs hanging
overhead. Their progress, too, was challenged
by huge boulders and rocks, and, here and
there, a fallen tree.</p>

<p>Finally, at a lofty elevation, they reached
the far side of the mountain. There were
plenty of gaps, now, in the flying clouds,
through which the moonlight streamed with
weird effect. A scene of wild and impressive
grandeur was before them.</p>

<p>“Old Eagles’ Peak, boys!” exclaimed
Pete, waving his hand toward a snow-capped
summit which rose high above the timbered
slopes.</p>

<p>“Magnificent!” murmured Dave.</p>

<p>“Perfectly corkin’!” exclaimed Cranny.</p>

<p>“I reckon as how we might give a couple
o’ good old cowboy yells, fellers,” said Jed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
“Sounds carry an awful long way in the
mountains.”</p>

<p>The crowd halloed again and again, but
there was not even an echo to answer their
calls. They looked eagerly about in every
direction.</p>

<p>But in all that vast landscape of valley
and mountain, timbered slopes and areas of
barren rock, there was nothing to reward
their search.</p>

<p>“Now what’s to be done?” asked Tom, in
anxious tones.</p>

<p>“Keep a-goin’, youngster,” answered Pete,
gruffly. “I ain’t s’prised. Many a time I
told ye it weren’t nateral ter fly; an’ now
I s’picion ye’re beginnin’ to think so yerselves.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE EAGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a strong wind at its back, the “Ogden
II” rose gracefully in the air. Bob Somers
realized that the utmost skill and care would
be required, and was satisfied to keep at a
comparatively low altitude. Gradually, however,
he increased the power, until they were
racing along at dizzy speed.</p>

<p>Far ahead the “Border City” appeared as
a mere speck, but the aviator felt that if they
were not obliged to descend the biplane would
overtake the dirigible long before the mountains
were reached.</p>

<p>“And by that time Major Carroll may have
regained control,” he reflected.</p>

<p>The wind droned and sighed against the
planes, while occasionally a stronger gust,
striking the machine obliquely, rocked it
gently. Then the aillerons, or balancing
devices, attached to the main plane began to
work automatically, some bending up, others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
down, in this way creating a difference in the
air pressure which quickly restored the biplane
to an even keel.</p>

<p>Bob Somers at length threw on full power.
The pulsating roar of the engine and whirr of
propeller blades were sent far off on the wind,
carrying fear to the cattle browsing on the
prairie below.</p>

<p>As mile after mile slipped behind them,
the two boys saw with great satisfaction the
cigar-shaped hull no longer appearing as a
patch of gray but beginning to show distinctly
the effects of light and shade. The chain of
mountains, too, which hemmed in the plain
was looming up faintly through a dark, murky
atmosphere. One lone snow-capped peak
shone delicately white.</p>

<p>As Bob sent the biplane nosing its way
slightly higher, Cranny Beaumont’s thoughts
were busy. So far, the “Border City” had
not shown the slightest indication of descending;
indeed, the big lad was quite certain that
the runaway balloon was rising.</p>

<p>“Suppose we have to follow ’em right over
the mountains,” he reflected.</p>

<p>Almost every theory he had ever heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
explained regarding the vagaries or dangers
of air currents rushed into his mind with disconcerting
clearness. Each gust of wind
which struck the planes gave him an unpleasant
shock.</p>

<p>“How in the world will Bob Somers ever
make a turn in a wind like this?” Cranny
looked hard into the aviator’s face, as if to
read his thoughts; but all he saw was a determined,
set expression.</p>

<p>The jagged mountain crests were now cutting
more crisply against the sky. A long
line of undulating foot-hills, some forest-covered,
others bald ridges, rolled back in ever-increasing
height to the mountains beyond.
And Cranny knew of many deep gorges, rushing
torrents and high precipices which existed
amid the wilderness.</p>

<p>Now they were traveling over the sheep
country. Flocks of thousands covered the
plains. The boys could see them, terrified
by the flying machine, scampering wildly
about, and forming masses of a grayish white
that continually changed their outlines. Some
distance off, a watercourse fringed with willows
wound its snake-like way over the grass-covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> 
floor. Swiftly the biplane approached
this gleaming line, passed across and left it far
behind.</p>

<p>The “Border City” was steadily growing
larger. In a short time the two craft would
be racing side by side. And what then?</p>

<p>Bob Somers’ brow was furrowed with anxiety.
He heartily wished that there was some
means by which he could communicate with
Major Carroll.</p>

<p>While these perplexing thoughts were passing
through his mind the aviator’s attention
was attracted by the sight of a bird flying
some distance below.</p>

<p>“An eagle!” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>Although the biplane was shooting ahead
at a terrific rate, the great bird easily kept
pace with it, occasionally soaring upward, as
though its curiosity was aroused by this giant
rival of the air.</p>

<p>“I only hope the old chap doesn’t get too
inquisitive,” thought Bob. He exchanged
glances with Cranny Beaumont. “I’d hate
to hurt him.” He smiled grimly, and looked
toward his revolver. “But maybe it’s a good
thing that Cranny and I brought these along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>As the eagle began to fly straight toward
them, Bob operated the control levers again,
and the biplane, responding, rose slightly
higher. He kept his eyes fixed intently on
the bird, and, in spite of their situation, could
not help admiring the ease and grace of its
movements. The great wings were beating
the air with rhythmical precision.</p>

<p>Higher, still higher, soared the eagle. A
harsh, challenging scream rose faintly above
the roar of engine and propeller.</p>

<p>“It surely won’t be foolish enough to attack
us,” mused Bob.</p>

<p>He again turned his eyes toward the “Border
City.” The air-ship, silhouetted against
the dark, lowering sky, presented an impressive
spectacle. It was now not far distant,
and the details were coming into view.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king of the air was keeping
up the race. But Bob had too much to think
about, for the moment, to even glance toward
it.</p>

<p>A strong cross-current of wind suddenly
wobbled the planes, causing the aillerons to
flop anew. The broad prairie had been left
behind; they were flying over a chain of rugged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
foot-hills. The aviator could see, far below,
deep gorges, masses of reddish rock, and green
forests passing by in kaleidoscopic fashion.</p>

<p>The mountain ahead, forming a stern and
forbidding-looking barrier, rose high above
them; and it was now apparent that the
snow-capped peak, which glistened strangely
white in the darkening atmosphere, reared itself
immediately beyond.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” muttered Bob. “Major Carroll
is throwing out ballast.”</p>

<p>Quantities of sand, as bags were emptied,
could be seen falling—curious misty patches
of a lightish color that streaked downward in
showers, to speedily spread out and fade from
view.</p>

<p>As patch after patch appeared, and melted
away, the “Border City” rose perceptibly.
The aeronauts had evidently decided to cross
the mountains.</p>

<p>“If Major Carroll can’t rise high enough to
clear those summits, they’ll be in awful danger.”
Bob Somers spoke his thoughts aloud.
“Crickets!” His face paled slightly under
its coat of tan. “I guess this is adventure
enough for even Cranny Beaumont.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>The latter’s eyes were sparkling with excitement;
his gaze constantly shifted from the
“Border City” to the eagle below, then toward
the mountain peaks, which every instant
seemed to present a more threatening aspect.</p>

<p>The proportions of the runaway dirigible
were looming up in all their hugeness; but a
few minutes more, at the present rate of speed,
and the “Ogden II” would be shooting past.</p>

<p>The brief interval of time passed, the roar
of the engine lessened, and the biplane drew
abreast of its monster rival.</p>

<p>The boys were too eager, now, to pay any
further attention to the feathered form flying
below. Strange thrills coursed through them,
as they looked at the air-ship and its occupants
scarcely a hundred feet away. Willie
Sloan was waving his hands vigorously.</p>

<p>The coverings of the car had been rolled up
in places, exposing to view a part of the interior.
A network of wire ropes and steel
tubing glimmered dully, while the planes
fore and aft and the great rudder at the rear
showed ghostly white.</p>

<p>Bob Somers steered the “Ogden II” still
closer to the runaway, shutting off as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
power as he dared. Strong cross-currents of
wind began to make themselves felt, blustering
between the planes, sometimes tipping
them slightly, or causing peculiar, ominous
vibrations to send chills down their backs.</p>

<p>“Hello the ‘Ogden II’!” came a hail, which
the boys were scarcely able to hear above the
roar of the engine.</p>

<p>Major Warfield Carroll was calling through
a megaphone.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” yelled the boys, in unison.</p>

<p>“Our engine can’t be made to work. Many
thanks for your kindness and bravery, boys;
but I insist upon your making a landing at
once.”</p>

<p>His words were barely distinguishable.</p>

<p>Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>“But I insist again that you do nothing of
the sort!” shouted the Major, with all his
force. “We’ll be able to rise high enough to
clear the mountains, and are in no danger.
Don’t you know that in a short time you will
find yourselves in the midst of most dangerous
air currents?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t think of giving up the chase!”
cried Cranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>The “Ogden II” was beginning to glide
downward. The engine, put under additional
power, drowned the next words which Major
Carroll flung toward them. But there was a
strange tone to his voice which made the boys
look at each other in surprise.</p>

<p>The explanation came an instant later.</p>

<p>The eagle, momentarily forgotten, shot into
view so close beneath that its glittering eyes
and cruel-looking beak could be clearly seen.
Its magnificent, spreading wings were flapping
furiously.</p>

<p>Almost breathless, the two watched the bird
soaring still nearer. At intervals, it emitted
a scream that sounded above the incessant
din of the engine.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” Bob gave a long breath;
his nerves tingled with excitement. “It
looks as though we’re in for a scrap.”</p>

<small>OVER THE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> this new and startling situation confronting
them, the boys’ attention was diverted
from the “Border City,” now falling
rapidly behind.</p>

<p>Many minutes passed—tense, anxious minutes.
The eagle flew still closer; its menacing
attitude increased. Cranny Beaumont
drew his revolver from its holster; he was
ready for instant action; but neither he nor
Bob Somers had any desire to end the life of
the magnificent bird unless its own misguided
actions should render such a course absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>Momentarily expecting an attack, the boys
could do nothing but patiently await the next
move of their feathered foe. As the minutes
passed without any change in the situation,
Cranny twisted his head around, to see, over
his shoulder, the “Border City.”</p>

<p>The air-ship was drifting high above them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and he noted that bags of sand were still being
emptied one after another over its side.</p>

<p>“I’d give something to know what’s going
to happen in the next half hour,” he murmured,
grimly.</p>

<p>A magnificent panorama of mountains lay
straight before them—a succession of forest-crowned
slopes, of great precipices and gloomy-looking
gorges.</p>

<p>Bob Somers turned toward his passenger;
his interrogating look was immediately understood.</p>

<p>Cranny Beaumont nodded emphatically.
His lips framed the words:</p>

<p>“Let her rip, Bob; go as high as you
like.”</p>

<p>The big plane instantly began to rise,
while its unrelenting pursuer, as if accepting
this as an evidence of fear, uttered a wild
screech. The startled lads had a quick view
of a dusky form shooting ahead and above
them. They involuntarily shrank back in
their seats, as it circled around and swooped
fiercely to the attack.</p>

<p>Bob Somers knew, and so did Cranny
Beaumont, that a false movement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
controlling levers might place them in the
greatest peril. The latter was prepared; he
braced himself hard against the supports.</p>

<p>In another instant, the bird swept violently
against the upper plane only a few feet from
him, while beak, wings and powerful talons
seemed to resolve themselves into a confused
mass of pecking, beating and striking objects.</p>

<p>Crack, crack!</p>

<p>Two sharp reports came so close together as
to be almost blended into one. A thin wisp
of pungent smoke rolled backward. But
Cranny Beaumont, even in those moments of
danger, admired the great eagle too much to
sacrifice its life. The bullets sped harmlessly
into space.</p>

<p>His firing, however, produced exactly the
effect for which the lad had hoped. The
cracking of the revolver and flashes of flame
proved too much for the courage and fighting
spirit of the bird. With a cry of alarm, it
turned and flapped away. Then the boys, to
their great relief, saw it begin a wild swoop
downward.</p>

<p>They watched the eagle as it shot off into
space, one moment silhouetted against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
green pine forests, and the next passing across
rocky crags, until, finally, the heavy atmosphere
blotted it from view.</p>

<p>“A mighty lucky escape for us both, old
king of the air,” breathed Bob Somers, with a
great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>He steadied the rocking biplane, and glanced
behind at the “Border City.” The balloon,
considerably to the rear, had now risen to a
very high altitude.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to make a turn and come
about,” mused the aviator. “We’re leaving
them too far behind. Here’s a chance to test
my skill.”</p>

<p>Bob Somers’ forehead became knotted again.
In the stiff breeze, with the currents of air no
longer steady, he was facing a difficult task.
All his senses were on the alert to detect the
slightest indication of danger. Cautiously, he
operated the levers.</p>

<p>The flying machine, obeying these movements,
gradually changed its course, swinging
further and further around. The planes
began to tip, and, as the wind struck hard
against them, the boys passed through several
anxious moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Cranny, compelled to sit idle and trust his
safety entirely to the skill of another, managed
with difficulty to repress various shivery sensations
that would persist in running through
him.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II,” tipping at a thrilling
angle, soared around, soon righting itself
under the skilful guidance of the aviator.
In a few minutes they were flying off in the
opposite direction against a wind which blustered
and sang, or chanted musically, as it
raced past the planes. The two, at times,
were forced to bow their heads to the gusts.</p>

<p>The “Border City” seemed to be still ascending.</p>

<p>“I believe they’re high enough now to
cross the mountains in safety.” Bob Somers
spoke his thoughts aloud.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the biplane had left the
dirigible far astern. The aviator then worked
the pedals controlling the rudder and tail, sending
the machine around in a graceful curve.</p>

<p>Another series of thrills, as the planes
tipped; another breath-taking glide, and the
“Ogden II” was once more soaring in hot
pursuit of the air-ship. Cranny gave a whistle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
of astonishment; the biplane had climbed high
above the mountain summits, and was still ascending.
A haze seemed to be coming between
them and the earth.</p>

<p>When the lad raised his eyes, he saw peak
after peak looming up, while shining against
a waste of flying clouds towered the snow-capped
peak—a pinnacle of forbidding aspect.
Almost beneath them great walls of rock rose
precipitously, cleft by deep gorges, or crowned
with verdure-covered slopes. Every minute a
new surprise seemed to loom up in that wild
and enchanting scene.</p>

<p>And then it was that the reason for Major
Carroll’s course dawned upon Cranny’s mind.
Beyond the furthermost crags, a broad gray
expanse of plain, looking like the sea, stretched
off, to finally merge imperceptibly into the
gloomy sky.</p>

<p>“Ah ha; that’s it!” muttered Cranny.
“Foxy chap, that; won’t give up—expects to
get his engine going. Knows he’ll clear the
mountains, and be able to descend on the
other side.”</p>

<p>He looked toward the “Border City,” now
sweeping majestically above the first summit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>Bob Somers shut off as much power as he
dared. Already the biplane had begun to
rock, tremble, or wobble in the grip of deflected
currents of wind. Bob felt that it would be
foolhardy in the extreme to risk another
turn; from now on their only safety lay in
keeping to a straight course.</p>

<p>For some time the aviator had had an
ominous fact strongly impressed upon his
mind—the wind was veering.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s not the least doubt about it,”
breathed Bob. “And exactly in the wrong
way, too. The ‘Border City’ is surely heading
more and more in the direction of that
snow-capped peak.”</p>

<p>He managed to convey his thoughts to
Cranny Beaumont.</p>

<p>The big lad nodded vigorously; his face
clouded over with the gravest apprehension.
It was certain that the balloon could not clear
such a towering summit.</p>

<p>It was hard for the lads to feel that, although
so near to their companions of the air,
they were absolutely helpless to render them
the slightest assistance. Their gaze was fixed
on the great yellowish hull drifting some distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
below them, a plaything of the capricious
wind which urged it every moment
toward the great white barrier.</p>

<p>The biplane was shooting past again, rocking
in the gusts of wind, or shaken by convulsive
tremors. The aviator and his passenger could
see, gathered at the foremost end of the dirigible’s
car, not two figures, but three.</p>

<p>The passage of the “Ogden II” so close
above, however, seemed to pass unnoticed, as
though the three could think of nothing but
the great danger which confronted them.</p>

<p>“There’s still time, if the wind would only
change!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Consideration for their own safety denied
them a chance to look again. The cross-currents
tore and whirled against the planes;
it was a time when navigation of the air
required a cool head and steady hand.</p>

<p>Bob Somers’ face wore a look of resolute
courage. He had confidence in his ability to
weather the elements and pilot the craft over
the mountains to the plains beyond. But
what would be the fate of the “Border City”?
The wind showed no signs of veering back to
its original quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>A prey to doubts and fears, he held the
biplane on a steady course, watching the
incline of the mountain, as it seemingly
slipped up toward them, and the frowning,
snow-clad crags, close by, which they were
about to pass. It was an awe-inspiring picture
of the wilderness, solemn and grim, with its
darkened atmosphere and canopy of somber
clouds.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>ADRIFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one well acquainted with Major
Warfield Carroll recognized in him a man of
rather eccentric ways and ideas—one of those
who is apt to take likes and dislikes without
apparent cause. And yet his friends generally
found in the end that the stubborn, combative,
even hot-headed Major, in nearly all
cases, had very good reasons for his actions.
He possessed an intuitive knowledge of
human nature, and, as a matter of course, was
an excellent judge of character. Those fortunate
enough to gain his favor found in him a
real friend, one who, so long as they proved
themselves worthy, was glad to advance their
interests.</p>

<p>Early one evening, while he and the three
Ogdens were studying over some blue-prints
in a little office at one corner of the hangar, a
small lad, hot, dusty and tired, walked boldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
in, despite the commands of Walters to “make
himself scarce.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness, Mr. Ogden,” he said, wearily,
“but maybe I’m not tired.”</p>

<p>“Willie Sloan!” cried the inventor, in
great surprise, while his sons looked at the
boy as if not quite sure that they saw aright.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s William Brinton Sloan, P. G. S.,”
said Willie, with a faint grin.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing here?
Where are the others? Major Carroll, this is
one of the lads I spoke about.”</p>

<p>The financier’s sharp eyes were fixed full
upon him. Willie stared earnestly back.
His half-shy and half-impudent manner, somehow,
seemed to catch the Major’s fancy; but
the latter’s tone was stern, as he said:</p>

<p>“What have you to say, in answer to Mr.
Ogden’s question?”</p>

<p>“A whole lot—near enough to fill a book,”
gulped Willie. “I couldn’t stand that old
farmhouse any longer, so I—I—just lit out,
and——”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you actually
walked here?” demanded Rob Ogden.</p>

<p>“Yes; and it was something awful. I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
knew there were so many cows in the world.
And say, it was hot enough out there to bake
a pie.”</p>

<p>A twinkle of amusement shone in the eyes
of several.</p>

<p>“How did you find your way?” asked Major
Carroll.</p>

<p>“I struck out on a bee-line for the railroad,
and followed the tracks right into town.”</p>

<p>“But you might soon have become used to
Lone Pine, and enjoyed the experience.”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years,” protested Willie,
earnestly. “I don’t want to ride a broncho;
I don’t want to go up in that air-skimmer.
When the machine shop was closed, that settled
it.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise, I fear, the machine shop would
have been settled,” laughed Rob.</p>

<p>“Are you, then, interested in tools and
machinery, my lad?” asked the Major.</p>

<p>“Am I—am I!—Well, you just bet I
am!” exclaimed Willie, sinking down on a
stool. “I could live all my life in a workshop.”</p>

<p>The financier became interested.</p>

<p>“Tell me something about yourself,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
said. His usually brusque manner softened.
“No—on reflection, I think we had better
postpone that for a while. Ferd, if you are
going over to the Carroll, take him along.
Let him have everything he wants.” He
turned away. “Now, Ogden, as I was saying,
the idiot who drew this plan ought to be
drummed out of town; he——”</p>

<p>Willie, quite startled by the sudden change
in the Major’s voice, was glad to follow Ferd
outside.</p>

<p>At the Carroll Inn, he was assigned to a
pleasant room. After a good wash and a
bountiful meal he felt decidedly unlike the
lad who had walked across the prairie.</p>

<p>A little later on, Major Carroll listened to
Willie Sloan’s history of his life from the time
he was five years old up to the present. He
also learned that, above all things, Mr. Beaumont’s
ward disliked typewriting and office
work.</p>

<p>At intervals the financier smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>Then Willie, encouraged by his manner,
spoke earnestly about Cranny’s mission to
Border City; he said it would be a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
dreadful shame if Mr. Beaumont wasn’t supplied
with all possible information. He also
said several things which would have made
Cranny highly indignant had he heard them.</p>

<p>Major Carroll toyed with his watch fob,
smiled, and reflected. Being at the very head of
the progressive movement, he was, naturally,
inclined to offer Mr. Beaumont every encouragement.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that you get all the particulars,”
he remarked, briskly. “We are going to
have a great town here in a few years. There
are splendid opportunities for safe investment.
To-morrow, I shall find time to put
you on the right track.”</p>

<p>The Major, in his enthusiasm, seemed to
disregard the fact that his hearer was merely
a boy.</p>

<p>A strange expression began to creep over
Willie Sloan’s face. He had generally found
himself treated as a person of small importance,
and the Major’s tone and manner touched
a chord in his nature which had seldom, if
ever, been played upon. He brightened up
perceptibly.</p>

<p>“And I’ll write to my guardian,” he declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
energetically. “I’ll make Cran and
old Doctor Clifton sit up and take notice.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Clifton?” queried Major Carroll.</p>

<p>“He’s a huge six-footer,” said Willie.</p>

<p>“Keeping a friendly eye on you youngsters,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks he is,” chuckled the
boy.</p>

<p>“Won’t he object to your staying at Border
City?”</p>

<p>“No indeed!” answered Mr. Beaumont’s
ward, ending his words with a peculiar little
gasp.</p>

<p>If some of Major Carroll’s intimate friends
had been at Border City for the next few days
they might have noted another evidence of
his eccentricity—he allowed Willie to amuse
himself as much as he pleased in the hangar.</p>

<p>“Any lad who takes so great an interest in
mechanics as he does should be encouraged,”
he declared to Mr. Ogden, Senior.</p>

<p>Willie began to lose his habitual air of discontent;
he became active, going errands for
the Major with eagerness and a desire to please
which would have made Mr. Beaumont open
his eyes with astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>The days which followed were pleasant ones
to the lad. Even Kindale admitted that he
had a decided aptitude for machinery. The
Ogdens, however, believing that it was only a
passing fancy, smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>One afternoon the mechanics, and several
assistants requisitioned from a crowd which
usually lounged about the hangar, began to
haul forth the great balloon.</p>

<p>A cheer came from the crowd when the
cigar-shaped air-ship, weighted with bags of
sand, and held captive by means of ropes,
rested outside the building.</p>

<p>Willie pleaded earnestly to be allowed to
ascend.</p>

<p>“But won’t you be afraid?” asked the Major.</p>

<p>“No indeed! It isn’t like an air-skimmer;
there’s a solid floor to stand on.”</p>

<p>“There is only a moderate breeze blowing,”
explained the Major. “I have been waiting
for just such a day as this—neither absolutely
calm nor too windy; and, incidentally, I wish
to experiment with a new steering gear. I
suppose there is no harm in your going. Come
along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>He stepped quickly up the gangplank,
with Willie at his heels. Kindale had already
taken a stand by the engine.</p>

<p>“We won’t be long, Ogden!” called the
Major, presently. “Let go, men!”</p>

<p>Slowly and majestically the “Border City”
began to rise.</p>

<p>This time Willie experienced no feeling of
nervousness or fear as he saw the ground being
rapidly left behind. Viewed from the
cozy interior of the car, it seemed to be a perfectly
safe proceeding, although, at first, the
decided tilt of the balloon made his footing
rather insecure.</p>

<p>When the “Border City” came to an even
keel again the hangar was far below.</p>

<p>“We have reached an altitude of about a
thousand feet,” explained Major Carroll, who
was at the wheel.</p>

<p>“If the balloon goes much higher it’ll be
cloud-scrapin’,” murmured Willie. Then he
added, to himself: “After this, those dubs at
Lone Pine won’t think I’m afraid of everything.”</p>

<p>Entranced by the view, he gazed earnestly
out of the mica-covered window. The town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
lay off to one side, a scattered group of houses
on the dark, loam-covered prairie.</p>

<p>The balloon answered to the slightest movement
of the helm, forcing its way against the
wind, or rising and descending when the levers
which controlled the balancing device
were operated.</p>

<p>“It’s simply stunning!” cried Willie.
“Please don’t sail back just yet, Major Carroll.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take a short trip across the prairie,”
replied the aeronaut, with a smile.</p>

<p>As they rose still higher a stronger current
of air was encountered. The engine pounding
away at full speed, and the steady wind,
now at its back, sent the “Border City”
through the air with a rapid but easy gliding
motion.</p>

<p>Before the hills which cut across the prairie
were reached Major Carroll sought a lower
level, piloted his air-ship about, and she was
presently beating a passage slowly back to
Border City.</p>

<p>He hovered over the town long enough to
perform several evolutions which highly
amazed the entire population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Suddenly the throbbing of the engine
ceased.</p>

<p>Major Carroll turned and gazed sharply
along the length of the car; then, as the
sound did not begin anew, he roared:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Kindale?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to find out, sir!”</p>

<p>With an exclamation of impatience, Major
Carroll immediately began to lash the wheel
fast.</p>

<p>“Hang the thing!” exclaimed the engineer,
as he walked up. “This is certainly
exasperating, eh, Major?”</p>

<p>“You ought to have the engine working in
a few minutes, Kindale.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, sir.”</p>

<p>Together, they proceeded to examine the engine,
battery and wires, while Willie, deeply
interested, looked on. It soon became apparent
that the trouble lay with the electrical
apparatus, which failed to ignite the explosive
mixture within the cylinders of the motor.
Occasionally the spark gave an encouraging
indication of resuming work; but that was all.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Border City, left
further and further behind, became a curious-shaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> 
mass of grayish white against the
gloomy waste of plain.</p>

<p>The engineer tinkered; the Major tinkered;
and, doubtless, Willie would have tinkered
had there been a chance. But their efforts
continued to be unavailing.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness! Is there any danger of us
staying up here forever?” piped Willie.</p>

<p>“Depends upon three things, son—the engine,
the wind, and Major Carroll,” answered
Kindale, gruffly.</p>

<p>The financier squared his jaw.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to lose any of the gas, except
as a last resort, Kindale,” he said, emphatically.
“We had trouble enough getting the bag in
its present fine condition.”</p>

<p>“The wind ain’t goin’ down none, sir.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for making every effort
to avoid descending. A landing would
be difficult, and might have disastrous consequences
to the balloon.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, sir.”</p>

<p>“And even at the worst we can float in
safety until the wind simmers down.”</p>

<p>“How about the mountains?”</p>

<p>“We can easily rise high enough to cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
them. Beyond, according to my maps, is a
great stretch of plain. By George, it will be
time enough to crawl when we reach it.”</p>

<p>“It’s certain there ain’t no danger,
Major,” said Kindale. Then, as the financier
walked impatiently away, he added, in
an aside to Willie: “That’s him—don’t
never know when he’s beat, an’ never
will. Likely as not we’ll sail around the
whole earth.”</p>

<p>Although the aeronauts continued to make
every effort to get the “Border City” under
control, it drifted on and on, while the wind
gradually increased in force.</p>

<p>The pursuit of the biplane highly exasperated
the financier.</p>

<p>“I admire the courage of those lads,” he
stormed, “but it’s absolutely foolhardy, as
well as useless. But for the rugged foot-hills
below us, I’d descend right now, rather than
have them run any further risks.”</p>

<p>“It’s the plains, or nothing, now, for the
‘Border City,’” said Kindale, dryly.</p>

<p>Occasionally Willie lent his small stock of
strength in aiding the men to empty heavy
bags of sand. As they rose higher, the immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
panorama outstretched before his eyes
gave him a peculiar feeling of awe.</p>

<p>The biplane finally approached, but Kindale,
still struggling hard with the refractory
batteries, made no effort to see it.</p>

<p>Major Carroll’s hailing of Bob Somers and
the sight of the “Ogden II,” flying like an enormous
bird so close at hand, seemed more like
a strange dream than reality to Willie Sloan.
So did the remarkable actions of the eagle.</p>

<p>The change in the wind upset all of the
Major’s calculations. The two men talked together
in low tones, for neither wished to
alarm the lad; but each realized that unless
it veered back to its original direction, they
might find themselves, before very long,
placed in a position of great danger.</p>

<p>“Those daring youngsters on the aeroplane
worry me, too,” confessed the Major.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t bother about ’em,” advised
Kindale. “They’ve got nerve enough to get
the best o’ a hurricane o’ flyin’ cats. What I
don’t like is that white-bearded peak which
seems to be stickin’ up there jist a-purpose to
git us. Never could see no good in mountains,
anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Willie Sloan began to feel badly frightened.
The stormy waste of clouds seemed to be close
overhead. He watched them flying along,
expecting every minute to see their ragged
edges flung off into pelting drops of rain—the
prelude to a steady downpour.</p>

<p>“My, those mountains look simply terrible,”
he muttered. “And whew, but it’s awful
cold.”</p>

<p>He pulled his coat collar closely about his
neck, and, shivering with the chill air and
anxiety, walked toward the engine.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s to be done, Major,”
he heard the engineer confess.</p>

<p>“Then we’re bound to cut off the top o’
that mountain, eh, mister?” piped Willie,
still more excited and alarmed.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, the lad walked
quickly to the forward end of the car. He
was only dimly conscious of the fact that the
“Ogden II” continued to stand by them.</p>

<p>The “Border City,” at a high altitude, was
now over the mountain crests and approaching
the grim-looking peak which dominated
them all. Its summit pierced the lowest strata
of clouds and disappeared from view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>The dark, ominous aspect of nature increased;
the forests and crags were almost
swallowed up in the dense, gloomy atmosphere.</p>

<p>He hurried back, and found Major Carroll
and his engineer paying out a rope through
an opening in the bottom of the car.</p>

<p>“It’s the anchor,” explained the Major.
“Don’t be alarmed, my boy; it ought to stop
us.”</p>

<p>Willie Sloan walked to the rail and deliberately
looked downward. At any other time,
he might not have been able to view the immense
void beneath without being overpowered
by a feeling of dizziness, but now his gaze was
almost steady. It rested upon the anchor
dangling nearer and nearer the earth. The
iron seemed almost touching, yet it was still
being lowered.</p>

<p>“Goodness! If it only catches in something
and holds, won’t I be glad?” murmured
Willie.</p>

<p>He suddenly became aware of a damp,
sticky feeling sweeping across his face. He
lifted his eyes, with a start of surprise, to see
masses of vapor swirling through the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“The clouds!” he cried, in an awe-struck
voice.</p>

<p>The “Border City” was speedily enveloped
from stem to stern; and the mist rolled thicker
and thicker, until everything beyond a few
yards became blotted out. The men, still engaged
in lowering the anchor, appeared as
shadowy, gigantic figures.</p>

<p>“My; this is the worst yet!” Willie
groaned.</p>

<p>He vainly tried to make out their position;
but the veil seemed to have become even
more dense and impenetrable.</p>

<p>In another moment, he was almost jerked
off his feet by the sudden slowing up of the
car.</p>

<p>“The anchor’s caught; eh, Major Carroll?”
he cried, joyfully.</p>

<p>“So it would appear, son,” came a voice
through the fog.</p>

<p>The “Border City,” swinging and wobbling,
tugged hard on the cable. Willie
groped his way along, occasionally glancing
over the rail, without seeing anything, however,
but the blanket of rolling mist. Everything
was enveloped in its chill and sticky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
grip; the ropes and tubes dripped with moisture;
it crept around his neck, and whirled
against his eyes and ears. The big hull assumed
a spectral look, and the gloom was like
that of approaching night.</p>

<p>The shadowy figures were presently standing
by his side, peering over the rail.</p>

<p>“It’s gettin’ thicker, Major,” said Kindale.</p>

<p>“I think this cloud will soon pass by.”
Major Carroll laid his hand upon Willie’s
shoulder. “Don’t be frightened, my lad,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I am, though. Are we going to stay up
here all day?”</p>

<p>“I hope not. Let’s get busy, Kindale.”</p>

<p>The men walked to the windlass around
which the cable was wound.</p>

<p>Willie watched them, as they turned it
slowly and laboriously. The captive balloon
strained hard on the rope, while the cold wind
moaned and whistled monotonously past.</p>

<p>“I see a hole in the clouds, sir!” yelled
Willie, at length.</p>

<p>“Good!” grunted Kindale.</p>

<p>“How far down are you going?” asked
Willie, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“To within a short distance of the ground,”
explained Major Carroll. “The rest of the
way we shall have to descend by means of a
rope ladder.”</p>

<p>“And what then?”</p>

<p>“We must get word to Border City. Perhaps,
after all, our young friends in the
aeroplane may be able to render us a service.”</p>

<p>“The Ogdens will have to see that we get
some batteries in the biggest kind of a hurry,”
supplemented Kindale.</p>

<p>“Sounds mighty easy,” muttered Willie,
“but we may have the dickens of a time
climbing down the mountain. Besides, it’s
an awful way back to the prairie.”</p>

<p>The mist was beginning to open out.
Willie’s eyes eagerly followed the line of
the cable through a rugged rift, to see it
disappear in the midst of a thick clump of
trees. The openings became more numerous,
until, at last, the moisture-laden and dripping
“Border City” was no longer immersed
in its vapor bath.</p>

<p>As Willie Sloan, much relieved, began
walking toward the forward end, a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
jolt swung him against the rail. He uttered
a startled exclamation, and looked below.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness—goodness!” he wailed,
thoroughly alarmed. “The anchor has torn
loose.”</p>

<p>The balloon had, indeed, resumed its drift
toward the mountain.</p>

<p>“It’s ketched onct; it’s likely to ketch
ag’in,” cried Kindale, encouragingly.</p>

<p>Willie breathlessly watched the anchor,
seemingly but a tiny speck, slipping and
sliding over a bald ridge of rock. He braced
himself and held tight to the slanting rail.
The feelings of a shipwrecked mariner, who
sees his vessel being borne through the surging
waves toward a line of foam-crested
breakers, and destined to be pounded to
pieces on a rocky shore, took possession of
him. His eyes were fixed, by turns, upon a
broad white surface towering high above
them. At about their own level, he saw
bold reddish crags and steep slopes partly
covered with fir and pine.</p>

<p>“Can’t anything be done, Major Carroll?”
he asked, despairingly.</p>

<p>“The anchor is our sole dependence,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
the millionaire. Then, as he noted
the blank look which came over the boy’s
face, he hastened to add: “We are not in
any danger. Keep cool, and trust to us.”</p>

<p>Several times the trailing anchor seemed
on the point of arresting their progress
again; but just as Willie began to feel his
hopes revive, the tremendous strain on the
cable tore it free, and each minute the
“Border City” was drifting nearer and
nearer to the barrier. The men stood by
the lad, awaiting developments in silence.</p>

<p>“It’ll strike head-on, sir,” said Kindale,
in a voice which reached only the Major’s
ears.</p>

<p>The rocks and trees stood out dark and
grim amidst the somber, sullen-looking landscape,
but with a clearness which showed
how near they were. Willie watched in
breathless suspense, while the air-ship slowly
swung about in the cross-currents of wind.</p>

<p>The expected moment soon arrived. He
felt the car shiver and jar—the “Border
City” had struck.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>PRISONERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great hull collided head-on, as Kindale
had predicted; then, swinging sideways,
scraped and bumped along the rough, scarred
side of the mountain, which sloped precipitously
downward.</p>

<p>Willie Sloan, pale and trembling, sought
courage from the men at his side. A look in
Major Carroll’s eyes reassured him.</p>

<p>“We’re all right, my lad,” exclaimed the
aeronaut, almost forgetting, in his solicitude
for the lad, his own misgivings.</p>

<p>The car still swayed violently. At intervals,
as the guide rope drew taut, there
came an alarming lurch, which was immediately
followed by another sweep forward.
Then the huge, unwieldy hull was borne
against an almost perpendicular wall of rock
with such force that it seemed almost on the
point of bursting.</p>

<p>As the air-ship, caught in a vortex of conflicting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
currents, rebounded, it turned sideways,
and presently drifted clear, the guide
rope hanging in front of a high precipice.
Some distance ahead a pine-covered spur extended
out from the mountain.</p>

<p>The eyes and thoughts of all three were centered
upon it. The “Border City” was again
floating above the rocks. To Willie Sloan, the
minutes seemed to drag with intolerable slowness.
His heart was beating fast.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, my lad,” again admonished
the Major. A grim look settled about
the corners of his mouth. “If necessary we
can abandon the air-ship as soon as it reaches
the spur.”</p>

<p>The “Border City” slowly approached the
crags. The tops of the pines, through which
the wind soughed with a musical murmur,
seemed to bristle upward, as though angry
at the intrusion of the monster and bent upon
its destruction.</p>

<p>Presently the anxious passengers heard the
branches of the taller trees beginning to strike
and grind against the bottom and sides of the
car. Not a word was spoken as they stood
by supporting themselves by the rail, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
shock after shock jarred the car from stem to
stern.</p>

<p>“Yards of money gone for the sake of a
few feet of gas and a little trouble, Kindale,”
murmured Major Carroll, regretfully.</p>

<p>“The anchor has ketched in something,
sir.”</p>

<p>The financier instantly realized that Kindale’s
observation was true. The tightening
rope had gradually stopped the air-ship, which
was now tipping more and more downward.</p>

<p>At last, beaten down by the force of the
wind, and struggling hard to break away, it
brought up against a tree top. A rending and
crashing of branches followed the impact of
the car.</p>

<p>Next instant, as if giving up the struggle,
the “Border City” began to settle on its side
amid the trees. The car, held by the solid
pine branches, tilted at a dangerous angle.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!—we’re going to be spilled out!”
gasped Willie Sloan, with a thrill of terror.</p>

<p>“No—keep cool!” called out Major Carroll,
in a reassuring voice. “This is the end
of our trip: we shall easily be able to reach
the ground in safety.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“We’re sure stuck tight enough this time,
sir,” said the engineer.</p>

<p>Again Kindale’s observation proved to be
correct. The air-ship was firmly held by the
drag rope. Its great hull, straining and tugging,
was as far in advance of the car as the
connecting framework would permit. With
every heavy gust of wind it dipped downward
at a sharper angle; then rose again.</p>

<p>The car had come to rest upon a bed of
waving pine boughs, while numerous branches
rested caressingly over its rail. The floor,
showered with needles, in places resembled a
carpet of green.</p>

<p>“A slight lad like you should have no difficulty
in reaching the ground.” The Major’s
cool, collected voice broke the spell of fright
which had held Willie Sloan in its grip.</p>

<p>“I think I can manage it, sir,” he said, in
a low tone, as he kept himself in an upright
position by holding on to the steel tubing.</p>

<p>“Of course you can.”</p>

<p>“I should call this one o’ the awkwardest
positions a man were ever placed in,” grunted
the engineer. “But still it could be a dozen
times worse. The propellers ain’t even broke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
Major, though they’re certainly caught tight
enough in those branches.”</p>

<p>Immediately following this remark, Kindale
proceeded to attach a heavy sand-bag to
a rope ladder, and, with Major Carroll’s assistance,
it was thrown over the side. Shifting
it about, in order to find favorable openings,
the men lowered away.</p>

<p>Boughs and masses of foliage were pushed
aside by the weight of the sand-bag; twigs or
small branches occasionally snapped. At
length some obstruction caught the bag and
held it fast.</p>

<p>“Can’t move it either up or down,” remarked
Kindale, after several long and vigorous
efforts. “Anyway, we’ll be able to climb
a few yards nearer the earth. I’ll go first,
Major.”</p>

<p>The engineer assured himself that the ladder
was secure, then clambered over the side
of the car.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment to Willie Sloan.
He watched Kindale swaying back and forth
on his apparently frail support and descending
cautiously toward the denser foliage below.
Almost immediately his form was hidden, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
only the sound of rustling leaves told of his
steady progress toward the ground.</p>

<p>“Kindale is surely not finding it a difficult
undertaking,” said the Major. “Your turn
next, lad.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I’m ready,” answered Willie,
with a little gulp.</p>

<p>A stentorian hail from the engineer reached
his ears:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Major. I’m not all the way
down, but I’ll wait here for the boy.”</p>

<p>Major Carroll assisted Willie over the side,
and kept a firm grip on him until he had
secured a footing on the ladder.</p>

<p>Away from the solid support of the car,
and for the first time entirely dependent upon
his own efforts, Mr. Beaumont’s ward found
that the surroundings had assumed an even
more wild and forbidding aspect. One glance
at the snow-covered heights above, and
another through an opening in the trees,
which showed a hazy patch far below, made
his knees almost tremble. Had he suddenly
found himself on the weather-vane of a
cathedral spire his sensations might have
been much the same as he experienced now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>Then thoughts of Tom Clifton, and what
Tom Clifton might say, if he could see him
perched so ridiculously high in the air, flashed
into his mind. They did him more good
than almost anything else could have done.</p>

<p>“I’ll just make old Dr. Thomas Cliffy
open his eyes,” he decided. “He’ll think I’m
a bird, all right. I’d like to be a bird for
about five minutes.”</p>

<p>As he started to lower himself from rung to
rung, the ladder began to sway, while gusts
of wind blew against him with a force that
made his heart flutter.</p>

<p>Down—down he went, pushing obstructing
branches out of his way. They became thicker
and thicker, forming an arching screen overhead
through which the big gas-bag appeared
as a mere, formless patch of dark.</p>

<p>The lad gave a violent start when a bird
unexpectedly darted out from amidst the
shadowed depths of the fragrant pines, and,
with a shrill cry, flew swiftly past.</p>

<p>“Take it easy, lad,” cautioned Kindale,
from below. “’Tain’t very far to the ground.”</p>

<p>Pine-needles were sweeping against Willie
at every step, scratching his hands and face;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
but he struggled on, even smiling grimly as
he discovered the engineer sitting astride a
limb just below.</p>

<p>“The sand-bag stuck right here,” explained
Kindale, “but there’s plenty o’ stout branches—nothing
to be skeered at, lad.”</p>

<p>“Who’s skeered?” grunted Willie.</p>

<p>“Not you, that’s sure,” laughed the other.
“You’re a brick. Easy, now! I’ll give you
a hand.”</p>

<p>With the assistance of the engineer, Willie
managed to climb upon a sturdy limb, uttering
a sigh of satisfaction as he eased himself
into a safe position.</p>

<p>“Take a rest, now, while I keep on,”
advised Kindale. “Yes; we’re still all right,
Major!” he yelled, in answer to a call which
came through the trees. “’Most down, now.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, after struggling from
branch to branch and crotch to crotch, Willie
Sloan dropped, safe and sound, to the earth.</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” cried Kindale. “You’re
a dandy!”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont’s ward grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Guess this beats all of old Doc Cliffy’s
adventures pounded into one,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
“Hello—hello, Major Carroll; we’re down-stairs
at last.”</p>

<p>It didn’t take the slight, active financier
very long to join them.</p>

<p>“We have been most fortunate,” he remarked.
His eyes lighted up with satisfaction,
as he glanced from one to the other. A
vigorous shake sent a shower of pine-needles
flying from his shoulders. “But a hard task
still confronts us. We must——”</p>

<p>“Get out of the woods,” chirped Willie,
whose mind was now relieved from all anxiety.</p>

<p>“Quite right,” laughed the Major. “I suppose
Doctor Clifton may have something to
say about this. But come on; we must find
a way to descend.”</p>

<p>Feelings somewhat like those of an explorer
who has landed upon some strange, untrodden
soil, coursed through Willie Sloan, as they
made their way around the trees. A delightful
fragrance of the pines filled the air.</p>

<p>Finally the forest thinned out, and the explorers,
following the edge of the spur, at
length emerged upon a stretch of barren rocks.</p>

<p>“I wonder where in the world Bob Somers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
and Cran have gone in that old air-skimmer,”
remarked Willie, after a long stare in all directions.</p>

<p>“I’d give a lot to know whether the boys
are safe.”</p>

<p>A troubled expression came over Major
Carroll’s face.</p>

<p>“Of course they are, sir,” said Kindale, confidently.
“Thunder! I do wish we could
find a way down this slope,” he added.</p>

<p>An hour’s thorough search convinced the
party that they were in a decidedly unpleasant
situation. On every side almost vertical
cliffs made descent impossible, while over-hanging
crags and slopes too steep to climb
prevented them from ascending.</p>

<p>The three finally came to a halt before a
smooth slab of rock which rose about twenty-five
feet above their heads.</p>

<p>“If we could get over that, Major, there’d
be a chance,” said Kindale, glancing critically
at the slope higher up. “It’s the only promising
place we’ve seen.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any possible way
for us to manage it,” returned the aeronaut.
His forehead knitted into a tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
frown. “There is nothing to catch a
rope or ladder.”</p>

<p>“Then it looks as though we’re up against
it hard,” murmured the engineer, in a low
tone. “Not a bite to eat; not a drop o’ water
to drink, an’ not a firearm among the three.”</p>

<p>“Prisoners—apparently!” said the Major,
with a gesture of impatience. “Yes, prisoners!”
he repeated grimly, casting a glance
toward Willie, who had wandered off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>BY MOONLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Bob Somers, you’re a crackerjack,
sure enough!” Cranny Beaumont uttered
these words with a heartiness that indicated a
decided conviction on the subject.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II” had crossed the mountains
and landed in safety on a gently rising swell
some distance beyond.</p>

<p>Cranny slapped the aviator on the shoulder
with a force corresponding to the enthusiasm
exhibited by his speech, whereupon Bob
winced and hastily drew away.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Cranny,” he said, “but I’d understand
without having the sentiments
pounded in.”</p>

<p>“Bob, I couldn’t help it. The way you
handled that biplane was simply great. I’d
call it a corkin’ fine experience but for——”</p>

<p>The big lad paused, while an anxious expression
replaced his habitual grin.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has happened to them,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
said Bob, musingly. “The ‘Border City’ has
certainly been blown against the mountain.”</p>

<p>“Sure as we’re standin’ here,” agreed
Cranny. “By Jupiter, wasn’t it mean luck
that the wind had to change?”</p>

<p>The two stared about them for a moment
in silence. Foot-hills and mountains rose at
their back, while in front a vast expanse of
prairie stretched off to the limits of view.
Here and there, masses of mesquite and
scrubby trees dotted its rolling surface.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done, Somers?” asked
Cranny, at length.</p>

<p>“Have a bite to eat, and wait for the wind
to quiet down,” answered Bob, with a glance
at the sky.</p>

<p>“Goin’ up again, eh?”</p>

<p>“If there’s a possible chance. But if you
don’t want to risk it——”</p>

<p>“See here, Bob”—the lad spoke in a highly
injured tone—“did you ever know me to
back out——”</p>

<p>“Never did, Cran,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“And you never will, either. I’ll go where
anybody else will, and maybe a bit further.
No Willie Sloan ’bout me, Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Poor little chap,” sighed Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s had such a scare that it’ll
take a year for him to get over it. I’ll be
mighty glad when to-morrow morning
comes.”</p>

<p>“By that time we ought to know more than
we do now, Cranny.”</p>

<p>Bob had taken the precaution to pack in a
small bag a supply of bacon, crackers and
cheese, so the two hurried toward a patch of
timber in search of fuel.</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes of brisk chopping,
Bob kindled a fire on the edge of the woods,
while Cranny filled the coffee-pot from the
canteens and got the cooking utensils ready.</p>

<p>The gloom slowly deepened; mountains
and plain began to grow dim and mysterious.
The “Ogden II,” some distance away, revealed
itself by ghostly patches of grayish
white and formless shadows; and, finally,
night closed around them.</p>

<p>The two found it difficult to keep their
restless feelings in check, often pacing to
and fro, while the flames sent their shadows
fantastically over the ground.</p>

<p>Hour after hour dragged out its tedious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
course; but, to the joy and relief of both,
the wind began to lessen and the gaps in the
clouds to constantly increase in size. Shafts
of silvery light fell across the plain; the snow
on Eagles’ Peak shone with a spectral luster,
while mountain crags and timbered slopes
appeared in places where before were only
gloomy masses of dark.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this great luck, Cranny!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Corking! What jolly sport it would be
but for——”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the impatient boys decided
that it was safe to make a start.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brilliantly as they
stamped out the fire. Then Bob, followed by
Cranny, walked briskly toward the “Ogden
II.”</p>

<p>The hum of the engine and whirr of the
propeller blades soon rose on the air. Under
the skilful guidance of Bob Somers, the
biplane began to soar toward the silvery-edged
clouds which still drifted in the grayish
expanse of blue.</p>

<p>Higher, still higher, with the moon sending
a faint, queer-shaped shadow over the prairie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
rose the “Ogden II.” A vast, seemingly unreal
world opened out before them, as they
swiftly winged their way toward the mountains.
Unheard exclamations of astonishment
and delight came continually from Cranny’s
lips.</p>

<p>Densely wooded foot-hills were soon directly
beneath them. Now, having risen far above
the crests of the nearer mountains, they were
able to look upon a scene of unparalleled
grandeur. Innumerable crags and peaks,
enveloped in the soft sheen of the moon,
stretched far off toward the horizon, glittering
in light, or steely gray in shadow.</p>

<p>The boys gazed into the dizzy depths below
with a feeling of awe. Here, they saw a
cascade, tumbling from ledge to ledge; there,
an inaccessible canyon, through whose gloomy
depths dashed a foaming torrent. In the mysterious
light, nature appeared but a ghostly
echo of herself.</p>

<p>The towering pinnacle of old Eagles’ Peak
loomed up nearer; the snowy surface began
to reveal its bald, rugged forms, its precipitous
slopes and glittering rocks.</p>

<p>But even the wonderful panorama and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
thrills of flying at a tremendous speed could
not relieve the intense feeling of anxiety
which the aviator and his companion experienced.
Their eyes continually roved over
the landscape for any signs of the “Border
City.”</p>

<p>“We’re likely to learn something mighty
soon,” murmured Bob. “Whew, but it’s getting
cold.”</p>

<p>An icy feeling was in the air; the wind
rushing steadily past carried with it an unpleasant
sting.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, as the “Ogden II”
began to skirt around old Eagles’ Peak,
the boys’ hearts fairly leaped with excitement
and hope.</p>

<p>The bright sparkle of a fire on a jutting
ledge had sprung into view; then disappeared,
as objects passed between; then
gleamed once more.</p>

<p>The boys saw something else, too. An
exultant yell came from Cranny’s lips.
There was no mistaking that huge, cigar-shaped
form which seemed to be resting
across the tops of a dense mass of pines.
The rounded surface of the “Border City”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
glimmered with light, or lost its outlines in
the surrounding shadows.</p>

<p>“It looks like some huge slumbering monster,”
thought Bob Somers, as, with a steady
hand, he directed their course still nearer the
spur, and toward the ruddy, dancing flames.</p>

<p>“Rah, rah!” He joined with Cranny
Beaumont in a shout.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II” shot far above the air-ship,
and they were looking down upon a
scene, on the edge of the forest, which made
their nerves tingle with joy. Around the
huge fire, three figures were seen, each wildly
waving his hands toward them.</p>

<p>“Safe—safe! Sure as I live!”</p>

<p>Bob Somers and his passenger exchanged
glances of the greatest satisfaction, and craned
their necks to keep in view the little group.</p>

<p>As Bob raised his head again, he had a
vague impression as of seeing a tiny star-like
point of light out of the corner of his eye. It
was, apparently, far distant, at the bottom of
a rolling valley.</p>

<p>Upon looking a second time, it had vanished
completely. Bob winked his eye hard.</p>

<p>“Yet I’m almost sure of it,” he murmured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
“Ah ha—there it is! Now what does that
mean?”</p>

<p>The star-like point had come plainly into
view between a gash in a deeply shadowed
slope. Cranny, too, had seen it. He put his
mouth close to the aviator’s ear.</p>

<p>“Look, Somers!” he yelled, with all his
force.</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ll investigate!” he roared, in reply.</p>

<p>Happy in the thought that their midnight
mission had been so successful, he changed
the course of the “Ogden II,” heading toward
the tiny beacon which flared and fluttered,
and constantly brightened, against the greenish-gray
background.</p>

<p>With a long, thrilling downward swoop, the
biplane shot ahead, while the jagged mountain
crests which hemmed them in rose higher
and higher. Presently they were skimming
across a patch of timber at a sufficiently low
altitude to see a number of tethered bronchos
wildly prancing about and several dusky
figures evidently staring toward them.</p>

<p>Bob Somers shut off all power for an instant,
allowing the machine to volplane. The earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
seemed to be racing toward them with terrible
rapidity.</p>

<p>Above the rush and hum of the wind striking
against the planes he heard a medley of
ringing shouts.</p>

<p>Both boys knew those voices, and, highly
delighted, both answered with telling effect
before the roar of the motor once more
drowned all other sounds.</p>

<p>Bob Somers eagerly scanned the valley,
determining to make a landing if possible.
After circling about in all directions, he at
length discovered a comparatively level stretch
overgrown with waving bunch-grass.</p>

<p>“Just the place; it ought not to be difficult,”
he reflected.</p>

<p>Cranny Beaumont understood his significant
look.</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Bob!” he yelled in his ear.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II” began to volplane again.
It was the most difficult undertaking of Bob
Somers’ short career as an aviator. But with
all his wits about him, he steered the machine
toward the most level stretch he could see.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ to make a corkin’ landing,”
muttered Cranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>The last stretch was before them; the bluish
shadow trailing over the ground and the flying
machine were rushing swiftly toward
one another. As Bob once again manipulated
the levers, shadow and substance joined—the
biplane had landed with a startling series of
jolts and bumps. But the two were safe.</p>

<small>TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, well; if this isn’t the biggest surprise
ever! My, but it was perfectly great of
you chaps to follow the racers.”</p>

<p>There wasn’t much chance for any one else
to talk while Cranny kept rattling on.</p>

<p>The two lads, after a great deal of shouting,
had been able to locate the searching party,
which was riding in the direction taken by
the “Ogden II.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can hardly believe it, even yet,”
went on Cranny. “An’ good old Dave here,
too! Yes; it’s an honest fact, Tom; we
have really seen Major Carroll and the others.”</p>

<p>“The good news you bring, and this reunion
in the poetic moonlight is one of the most
pleasant events in our whole experience,”
murmured Dave.</p>

<p>“Ye sure done it ag’in, Bob!” Jed Warren
spoke enthusiastically. “We’re proud o’ you,
eh, Pete?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>The grizzled features of the old cow-puncher
relaxed.</p>

<p>“Ye’re positive wonders, lads,” he said.
“Thar ain’t nobody on the hull range with
more grit’n you’ve got; an’ that’s sayin’ somethin’.
Shake!”</p>

<p>They shook.</p>

<p>“But that don’t mean ter say, ye understand,
that I believe in them thar arioplanes;
’cause——”</p>

<p>“It isn’t natural to fly, and it wasn’t ever
intended,” grinned Cranny. “Now, fellows,
let’s get over to your camp and talk about our
plans. We can leave the plane till morning,
eh, Bob? What’s that, Jed?”</p>

<p>“I were sayin’ as how them balloon fellers
is sure ketched up thar on the old Eagle,”
answered Jed. “That ledge ain’t j’ined as it
had orter be; I reckon as how the job weren’t
ever finished.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re sure right, pard,” assented Pete. “I
know’d a hunter onct—he was after some
mountain goats—he loses his footin’ an’ slips
down onto that spur. An’, d’ye know, the
old Eagle keeps him up thar three hull days
afore his pards comes acrost him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Have any trouble in getting out of his
fix?” asked Tom, eagerly.</p>

<p>“None as I ever hears ’bout. That bald-headed
old feller is a joker; he says: ‘If yer
friends is good ’nuff to come arter ye an’ shy
ye a rope, ye gits off easy; but ye can’t do
nothin’ much by yer lonesome.’ Understan’?
Inter the saddle, boys; an’ right after daybreak
we starts off, an’ the old Eagle will git
fooled ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Oh ho; isn’t it great the way things have
turned out, Bob?” murmured Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, ra-ther,” answered Bob, springing
up beside Jed Warren.</p>

<p>Tom Clifton’s sturdy little broncho was
soon struggling along under the combined
weight of the “Doctor” and Cranny. Progress
was necessarily slow; but, at length,
they were all gathered around the crackling
flames.</p>

<p>Although the summit of old Eagles’ Peak
reared itself, solemn and grand, against a star-studded
sky, a high ridge shut from view the
signal fire built on its spur.</p>

<p>The boys were tired that night and soon
turned in, sleeping soundly until the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
gray streaks in the eastern sky heralded the
approach of another day. They were aroused
by the gruff voice of Pete Sanderson, who was
already up, and cooking breakfast over a pile
of red-hot embers.</p>

<p>“Pitch in, younkers, an’ git yer grub,” he
commanded. “Mebbe them thar fellers ain’t
got none, an’ the old Eagle has a chanct ter
laugh ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Bob”—Dave Brandon yawned and rubbed
his eyes—“really, it isn’t safe to leave the
‘Ogden II’ unguarded; now, even though it
is a great sacrifice, you may borrow my pony,
while I——”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” snickered Cranny. “And who
will be obligin’ enough to lend me his
bronc’?”</p>

<p>“Maybe——” began Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s all settled,” announced Cranny, complacently.
“Thanks, Tom, old boy.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the departing horsemen
waved an adieu to the two volunteer guardians
of the “Ogden II.”</p>

<p>“A jolly hard tug ahead of us,” remarked
Sam Randall to Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>“You bet there is,” answered Tim. “It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
mighty lucky Pete and Jed are along. They
know all the trails and short cuts; so we won’t
find ourselves pocketed in some ravine or
gorge.”</p>

<p>“We don’t let nature make sport of us like
that,” grinned Sam. “Guess ‘Old Eagle’
isn’t the only joker around these parts.”</p>

<p>The cow-punchers, like generals in command,
led the advance, while the five boys, at
times riding almost abreast, at others strung
out in single file, followed them over ridges,
and around impenetrable masses of vegetation,
or through the aisles of whispering pine forests.
The early morning light sent a rosy
glow climbing up the tree trunks or trailing
over the ground; insects chanted; the songs
of birds sounded above the trampling and
crashing hoof-beats—all nature seemed to be
full of brightness and serenity.</p>

<p>“Cracky; isn’t this fine!” called out Dick.</p>

<p>“Corking!” said Cranny. “Maybe those
chaps won’t be glad to see us, eh?”</p>

<p>“You bet! Guess they aren’t used to such
high livin’,” chuckled Tim.</p>

<p>Old Eagles’ Peak was evidently a great deal
further off than it appeared. After an hour’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
steady march, the rugged heights still looked
discouragingly distant.</p>

<p>“Oh, for the ‘Ogden II’ again, Cranny!”
sang out Bob.</p>

<p>“It certainly does spoil a chap for traveling
like a snail,” grumbled the big lad, wiping
his perspiring face.</p>

<p>The scenery was wild and impressive.
Lofty peaks and gigantic crags loomed up
on every hand. Fallen tree trunks and other
obstructions seemed to challenge their efforts
to advance. But the cowboys always found a
way to master all difficulties, and by noon
the bronchos clattered upon a slope which
rose to a dizzy height above them.</p>

<p>Here they halted for lunch.</p>

<p>“It’s ’bout three hours more o’ tough work
for the ponies, Bob,” remarked Jed Warren.</p>

<p>“They are certainly chuck full of courage,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>He looked toward the little animals, whose
nostrils and shaggy sides were sending up
clouds of steam.</p>

<p>“Circle T Ranch has got the pick o’ the
plains,” grunted Pete. “Fall to, younkers.”</p>

<p>The boys promptly obeyed his instructions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
and when the march was resumed, a
short time later, both they and the horses
were considerably refreshed.</p>

<p>It was, as Jed Warren had said, hard on
the ponies; at times, it seemed as if the obstacles
which confronted them would prove
insurmountable; but men, boys or animals
never wavered. Stones were sent rattling
down steep descents; ledges, with only a few
yards between them and a plunge of hundreds
of feet, crossed.</p>

<p>Scarcely exchanging a word, they climbed
higher and higher. The snow on old Eagles’
Peak, in the full glare of the afternoon sun,
fairly dazzled their eyes with its brilliancy.
Halts were made with increasing frequency,
and in the shadows of the pine forests they
managed to find some relief from the oppressive
heat.</p>

<p>But gradually the torrid zone fell behind
them, and when, an hour later, Pete reined
up, the atmosphere was cool and refreshing.</p>

<p>“We’ll hev ter picket the bronchos here,”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The boys had been expecting this announcement
for some time. They were now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
at the edge of the timber. Above, they saw
a steep, almost barren area of glistening rocks.</p>

<p>Bronchos were tethered to the trees, and,
after saddle-bags and lariats had been slung
over their shoulders, the party were ready for
the final stretch. It was arranged that Sam
Randall should remain to guard the animals.</p>

<p>“Close to the old spur now, younkers,” remarked
Pete, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Mighty tough work ahead of us, though,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>Almost every instant one or another was
obliged to drop on his hands and knees, or
climb laboriously to the top of some obstruction.
It seemed a long time before they
scrambled around a bend, to see just ahead,
at about their own level, the end of the slope
cutting sharply against the tops of a dark
forest of pines. Beyond, stretching out like
a huge arm, the spur reared itself from the
blue, hazy depths of the valley.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted Cranny.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, the party was gazing
upon the spur from a bold elevation that rose
to a considerable height above it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span></p>

</figure>

<p>“Hello—there’s the old ‘Border City’!”
cried Dick. “Isn’t it the oddest-looking
bundle you ever saw?”</p>

<p>“Yell, fellows, so as to let the Spurites
know that the rescue expedition has arrived,”
burst out Cranny. He put his hand to his
lips. “Hello, Major Carroll! Whoop-e-e-e!
Hello-o-o-o!”</p>

<p>The voices of the others joined in loudly.</p>

<p>An answer almost immediately floated back
to their ears, and three dusky figures in the
distance were seen coming toward them, the
smallest and slightest keeping far in the
lead.</p>

<p>“Wee Willie!” laughed Cranny, joyously.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont’s ward raced madly forward
along the ledge.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious, Cran, but maybe I’m
not glad to see you!” he piped, in a shrill
voice. “Was I scared?—Oh, kinder. But
everybody said I had a whole lot of spunk—it’s
an honest fact, Cran.”</p>

<p>“We thank you heartily,” the Major called
up, his businesslike tones almost drowning
Willie Sloan’s excited flow of words. “You
have relieved us from a most embarrassing
situation, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Oh, say, Cran, haven’t you brought a bite
of somethin’ to eat an’ a drop o’ water?”</p>

<p>There was something so unconsciously
humorous in Willie Sloan’s outburst that
even Pete Sanderson guffawed loudly.</p>

<p>“We sartinly hev, lad,” said the latter,
kindly.</p>

<p>While Jed Warren was lowering provisions
by means of his lariat, explanations were exchanged,
until both parties had learned all
the particulars.</p>

<p>“Wal, this hyar ain’t doin’ nothin’,” broke
in Pete Sanderson, abruptly, at last. “Arter
ye git some grub, Major, I s’picion as how
ye’d like ter hit the back trail with us?”</p>

<p>Major Carroll’s glance rested upon Bob
Somers.</p>

<p>“I feel confident that, with a new set of
batteries, the ‘Border City’ will fly as well as
ever,” he said. “Now, Somers, I almost hesitate
to ask such a great favor, but the skill
you have shown in handling the ‘Ogden II’
is my justification; could you——”</p>

<p>Bob understood, and nodded.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Major,” he answered. “I’ll
skip over to Border City in the biplane, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
bring back whatever apparatus you may
need.”</p>

<p>“You will place us under everlasting obligations,”
said Major Carroll.</p>

<p>“I’m going, too, Bob Somers,” announced
Cranny, decidedly. “Let’s start right away.”
He crooked his finger, and this significant
motion catching Willie Sloan’s eye, made the
boy walk some distance away from Major Carroll
and Kindale.</p>

<p>The big lad followed him along the edge of
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Well, Cran?”</p>

<p>“See here, Willie, did you really write to
dad?”</p>

<p>It was an eager question, spoken in a low tone.</p>

<p>“I certainly did, Cran.”</p>

<p>Cranny’s eyes snapped; the aggressive tilt
of his jaw became more in evidence.</p>

<p>“And what did you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh,—an awful lot. But you’re a good
chap, after all. I’m—I’m——”</p>

<p>“Sorry?” snapped Cranny, with a dreadful
frown.</p>

<p>“No; going to see if there’s anything more
to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>Willie thereupon ended the unsatisfactory
conversation by hurrying away.</p>

<p>After Major Carroll had disposed of his
cold lunch, a brief council was held. It was
decided that the cow-punchers and boys
should make a camp and await the return of
Bob Somers and Cranny Beaumont from Border
City.</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to reach here early
to-morrow morning,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“And if everything goes as I hope it will,
the ‘Border City’ will soon after set sail for
the town,” remarked Major Carroll. “A
thousand thanks, boys.”</p>

<p>Good-byes were said; and Bob and Cranny,
with many expressions of appreciation and
encouragement ringing in their ears, hurried
away, leaving their friends to scramble back
to the woods at a more leisurely pace.</p>

<p>The day passed; night came, with a brilliant
moon shedding its luster over the
magnificent scenery, and, finally, morning
dawned.</p>

<p>But it was not until after one o’clock that a
shout in Cranny’s familiar voice announced
the near approach of the aviators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>The Ramblers and Jed Warren, uttering
loud whoops of delight, plunged through the
timber to meet them. They saw the two boys
urging their weary ponies toward the camp.</p>

<p>“Had a bully trip!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“Rah, rah!” cried Dick. “Did you get
all the stuff?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>Their arrival created considerable excitement
at “Eagle Camp.” Major Carroll and
Kindale received the batteries with profuse
thanks.</p>

<p>By means of lariats, which Pete had attached
to heavy stakes driven into the
ground, the boys lowered themselves one by
one to the spur.</p>

<p>The Major strode toward the balloon, with
the others almost at his heels.</p>

<p>Climbing up through the network of
branches wasn’t an easy task, and the interested
boys watched them with some trepidation,
all uttering sighs of relief when a hail
told them that the men had reached the
“Border City” in safety.</p>

<p>During the next hour, there was a great
deal of tinkering done by the two above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
tree tops, and every sound excited an immense
amount of curiosity on the part of those
below. Encouraging reports, however, kept
coming at intervals. Kindale finally stated
his belief that the engine would work as well
as ever.</p>

<p>“Here comes bulletin number fifteen,” said
Tim Lovell, as the Major’s voice was heard
again.</p>

<p>“We’re ready to free the propeller now,
boys,” he shouted; “so let Willie come along.”</p>

<p>The crowd grew enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Willie, boosted up on Cranny’s sturdy
shoulders, seized a low branch and began his
climb. The big lad followed him from limb
to limb. Mr. Beaumont’s ward soon reached
the rope ladder, and presently Cranny had
the satisfaction of seeing him peer downward
from over the rail of the “Border City.”</p>

<p>Cranny, obeying instructions from Major
Carroll, emptied the bag of sand, and released
the ladder, which was promptly drawn up.
Then, sitting astride a convenient limb, he
watched the men clearing away the branches
with hatchets and saws.</p>

<p>Cranny restrained his desire to give a rousing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
yell with difficulty, for he saw that the
tugging captive was almost dragging itself
free from the limbs, branches and masses of
foliage that encompassed the car. Its great,
long hull was considerably misshapen, but,
apparently, had suffered no serious damage,
and now swayed gently from a position almost
vertically above the car.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tree tops were agitated, as if
by a gale of wind; the dark object above
Cranny’s head seemed magically lifted away;
the guide rope reared itself from amidst the
timber, and the “Border City” was free.</p>

<p>The boys dashed and leaped through the
pine woods as if a pack of howling coyotes
was after them. At the first clearing they
stopped, and, although almost breathless,
managed to give another shout when they saw
the “Border City” high in the air, with the
cable dipping down in a long curve.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re going some now,” remarked
Cranny.</p>

<p>“And I’m real glad ter see it,” said Jed.</p>

<p>“Me, too—fur the first time,” added Pete
Sanderson, with a sort of grunt, “though it
don’t look no naturaler than it ever did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Bronchos were quickly saddled, and the
descent begun.</p>

<p>After several hours of, at times, difficult
and dangerous traveling, they finally came
within sight of the “Ogden II” and Dave and
Tom’s camp close beside it.</p>

<p>Of course the latter were delighted to see
them, and, as they found a great deal to talk
about, it was not until late in the afternoon
that a start was made for Lone Pine.</p>

<p>The “Ogden II” carried Bob and his
passenger high over the mountains, and, cutting
swiftly through the air, reached the grim
old ranch-house almost before the riders, following
the lead of Pete and Jed, had left the
last difficult pass behind them.</p>

<p>That evening they had a jolly reunion, in
which the cow-punchers took a prominent
part. The telephone between Lone Pine,
Circle T and Border City was used very often,
and many voices were sent over the wire. It
had the pleasing effect of seeming to bring
them and their friends, so far separated by
the lonely, darkened prairie, close together.</p>

<p>The dirigible got back to town safe and
sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“Isn’t it fine!” cried Bob. The receiver
was against his ear. “Willie’s at the ’phone.”</p>

<p>“Say, Somers,” he heard, “the Major thinks
a whole lot of you fellows. Wasn’t it awful
odd how that little red book changed things
for me? But for it I might be at Lone Pine
now, scrapping with old Doc Cliffy. He’s a
good chap, all right. But, look here, air-skimmers
are certainly not in it with balloons.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE VISITORS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inhabitants of Border City and the
cow-punchers and sheep raisers who occasionally
visited it had perhaps never dreamed that
there was destined to spring up in town a
building of such elegance and such arrangements
for comfort as the Carroll Inn.</p>

<p>Hot, dusty and generally silent, Border
City, apparently dropped on the prairie floor
with no more regard for its general plan than
if it had been a scattered heap of chips, had
become mildly famous, and the Carroll Inn
was worthy of its newly-acquired celebrity.</p>

<p>Since the advent of Major Warfield Carroll,
a trifling inattention on the part of the people
to the science of government had been corrected.
Border City had elected a mayor—the
principal street was named after him;
there were also a number of councilmen, a
magistrate, and a police force large enough to
afford protection to the town. There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
even two full-fledged political parties, each
with its “boss.”</p>

<p>Early on the morning following their return,
Major Carroll sat in his private room,
where Willie was poring over a book on mechanics.</p>

<p>A sharp knock sounded at the door. The
lad immediately answered it, and a telegram
was handed in.</p>

<p>“Goodness; it’s for Cran!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You told me that he is coming here to-morrow
morning, with the intention of starting
work in earnest, I believe,” said the Major,
with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“The telegram may be important. Better
call him up at Lone Pine.”</p>

<p>The telephone stood in one corner of the
room, and Willie was soon imparting the information
to Cranny.</p>

<p>“All right, Cran; just a second,” he said, a
moment later.</p>

<p>Hastily tearing open the envelope, Willie
glanced over the telegram, then uttered an
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Why—why—goodness!”—he stared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
hard at the Major—“Mr. Beaumont is coming
on!” he cried. His mouth was turned toward
the telephone again. “Cran—I say, Cran—your
father will be here this afternoon at five-forty.
No; it’s not a joke! This afternoon,
I say.”</p>

<p>“I can feel an awful row coming,” sounded
over the wire, in Cranny’s voice. It was
much weaker than usual, and had a sort of
despairing ring. “If dad had only given me
one week’s more time—just one week! I
can’t blame him for feeling sore, though.
Gee!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Cran.”</p>

<p>A confused buzzing sound, as of many
voices speaking at once, assailed Willie’s ears.
Then, presently, Cranny said:</p>

<p>“The whole crowd will be there in time to
meet the train. Good-bye, Willie.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beaumont’s ward, his face wearing a
rather odd expression, hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to meet your guardian,
Willie,” remarked Major Carroll, rising from
his chair. “Come—it’s time to leave for the
workshop.”</p>

<p>The boy followed him briskly down-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>At the hangar, Kindale and the other mechanicians
often found a use for his services.
Willie Sloan was always active now, and eager
to learn all he could.</p>

<p>About half-past four o’clock that afternoon
the boys from the ranch rode up to a long shed
which was built against one side of the hangar,
and dismounted; then, after tying their
bronchos, they made a concerted dash toward
the entrance.</p>

<p>“They sure ain’t got no rheumatiz.” This
from the art connoisseur.</p>

<p>“It’s only because they hain’t lived long
enough,” growled old Si Peterson.</p>

<p>In about five minutes the boys reappeared,
accompanied by a small, slight lad, and began
to walk briskly toward the road.</p>

<p>“Dad is certainly going to jump on me,”
remarked Cranny Beaumont, to the slight lad.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to jump pretty high, then,” said
the other.</p>

<p>“So the Major is at the inn?” said Dave.
“Well, he’ll soon have the pleasure of meeting
your father, Cranny.”</p>

<p>The big lad made no response. He wasn’t
in a very happy frame of mind, for he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
honestly intended to make a splendid showing
of the Border City business.</p>

<p>In front of the terminal were congregated
the usual crowd of people whose chief enjoyment
in life seemed to be in watching the
arrival and departure of trains. Guests of the
Carroll Inn as well as those from the “Black
Bear” and “Cattlemen’s Retreat” arrived.
A little later, the leading art connoisseur and
old Si Peterson wandered up, to lend their
presence to the gathering.</p>

<p>Cranny was watching the train. It didn’t
look like an ordinary train to him; it seemed
to typify the approach of fate. The shrieking
whistle, which again rolled over the prairie,
smote harshly upon his ears, as though it
mocked his failure and carried with it the
extinguishment of all hope for a further stay
in Wyoming.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it now,” murmured
Cranny, “but if I only had another week——”</p>

<p>“Gee, Cran; won’t it be great to see your
father?” cried Willie, breaking in upon his
thoughts.</p>

<p>In a moment more, the big locomotive
rumbled beneath the train shed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>The reception committee, including the art
connoisseur and old Si Peterson, did not intend
to miss a single thing which might
furnish an entertaining topic upon which to
wile away an hour or two. They saw upon
the platform of the third car two gentlemen
ready to alight, and also the crowd of boys
making a rush toward them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Beaumont!” called out Willie,
who led the advance.</p>

<p>Then he stopped short, gaping in astonishment
at a stout, florid-faced man, who, suit
case in hand, stood directly behind his guardian.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sharswood!” he gasped, faintly.</p>

<p>Yes, actually, it was Mr. Sharswood, of
Tacoma.</p>

<p>Cranny, too, was amazed. But even more
amazed to see his father’s face wearing a
genial, happy smile.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cranny! How are you, boys?”</p>

<p>The idle citizens witnessed the meeting, and
listened to scraps of conversation with the
greatest interest.</p>

<p>“Cranny, I’m delighted. You have done
wonderfully well—splendidly,” they heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
Mr. Beaumont say, as he grasped his son’s
hand and shook it heartily. “And I told Mr.
Sharswood your mission would be successful.”</p>

<p>Cranny Beaumont almost staggered; he
stared in utter bewilderment into his father’s
face, while, above the rapid flow of conversation
which followed, was heard a peculiar little
gasping chuckle.</p>

<p>“Eh—eh?” stammered the big lad.</p>

<p>Was Mr. Beaumont actually making sport
of him before all that crowd? It seemed like
it. And yet the expression on his face did
not seem to be assumed.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cranny, I’m proud of you,” went on
Mr. Beaumont, rapidly. “All the information
I wanted—nothing unthought of; every
detail clear and concise! But why did you
not write the letter yourself, instead of getting
Willie to do it for you?”</p>

<p>An idea suddenly flashed through Cranny’s
mind which dispelled his bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I—I——” he began. Then all the cool
composure of his nature came to his assistance.
He gulped once or twice.</p>

<p>“Dad,” he said, with a shrug of his broad
shoulders, “if you have the kind of information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
you want, don’t give me a bit of credit
for it. All that belongs to——” He laid his
hand on the shoulder of his father’s ward.</p>

<p>“Willie Sloan! Why, what do you mean?”
cried Mr. Beaumont, while the florid face of
Mr. Sharswood exhibited all the symptoms
of extreme astonishment.</p>

<p>“Just what I say,” answered Cranny,
frankly. “This young chap got ahead of me.”</p>

<p>The big lad thereupon explained clearly
and concisely just how matters stood.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Beaumont, I call that a manly
act on your son’s part,” exclaimed Mr. Sharswood.
“It comes hard to admit one’s faults
as freely as he has. I admire him for it; I do,
indeed, Beaumont. Cranny—your hand!”</p>

<p>The boys felt considerable curiosity to learn
the reason for the appearance of Mr. Sharswood
at Border City; but nothing was said
on the subject while the party was on its way
to the Carroll Inn.</p>

<p>They found the financier waiting to receive
them in his private room.</p>

<p>Cranny, having fully recovered his spirits,
made the introduction in his usual free and
easy manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“Sit down, gentlemen,” said Major Carroll,
waving his visitors to seats. He looked
sharply around, then added: “I thought
Doctor Clifton might be among you.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Clifton?” exclaimed Tim Lovell.</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Everybody stared hard at everybody else,
while Tom, turning furiously red, stood
twirling his cap.</p>

<p>A surprising little laugh came from Willie.
Then, rushing over, he seized the tall lad by
the hand and dragged him unwillingly forward.
“This is our Dr. Thomas Cliffy.”</p>

<p>“Why—why—he’s only a boy!” exclaimed
the Major, with surprise in his voice.</p>

<p>More confusion on the part of Tommy followed.</p>

<p>“I thought you said——”</p>

<p>“That he was a six-footer,” piped Willie,
“and called him Doctor Clifton—that’s all.”</p>

<p>A faint twinkle came into the financier’s
eye. He glanced at the two men and row of
smiling lads.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” he said, slowly. The twinkle
deepened; then he broke into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Cranny, an instant later,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
“isn’t he a sly little duffer, Dave? That’s
the time he put one over on you, Major.”</p>

<p>“Cranny—Cranny!” remonstrated his father.</p>

<p>The financier smiled.</p>

<p>“I have discovered that our young friend
Willie has a guileless, innocent way about
him,” he said, good-humoredly. “He did
what no one ever succeeded in doing before—completely
hoodwinked me.”</p>

<p>“I hope—I hope you’re not angry, sir,”
began Willie. “It seemed too good a joke to
spoil it. And, besides, isn’t he a six-footer?”</p>

<p>Tommy’s face had reached the limit of
crimson.</p>

<p>“Oh, for goodness’ sake, forget it!” he
snapped.</p>

<p>The Major, with a smile, disclaimed any
feeling of anger.</p>

<p>“Tom,” remarked Willie, in a low tone,
“that’s my last joke on you—honest. I
don’t feel grouchy, like I used to. Let’s be
good friends, eh?”</p>

<p>Tom instantly brightened up.</p>

<p>“Why, sure thing, Willie,” he said, cordially,
extending his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>The Sloan-Clifton feud was at an end.</p>

<p>“Well, it certainly beats the dickens how
things have turned out,” remarked Cranny.
“Why, here is Willie, who was just sent out
here to get livened up, an’——”</p>

<p>It wasn’t in the big lad’s nature to speak in
a whisper. Major Carroll overheard.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “Willie has livened up. I
predict that some day he will surprise us.”</p>

<p>The boy glanced proudly toward Mr. Sharswood.</p>

<p>“I believe that if every young fellow could
find out just what he is especially fitted for in
life the percentage of failures would be much
less,” said Major Carroll. “I hope you will
pardon me, Mr. Beaumont, for making an
observation; to my mind, this was the
trouble with your ward—he did not find the
work he was doing suited to his liking or
talents.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you tell me, Willie?”
queried Mr. Beaumont.</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t know myself,” answered
Willie; “I’ve just found out.”</p>

<p>The three gentlemen then began to talk
earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>Within a few minutes, Mr. Beaumont
leaned back in his chair and remarked:</p>

<p>“I am delighted. Even though nothing
more than this had been accomplished, I
would have been more than satisfied with
your trip. Willie shall go to a school of
technology. Cranny”—he laughed dryly—“I
was once a boy myself; I accept your explanation.
You have, at least, acted in a
manly fashion.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, sir; undoubtedly!” came
from Mr. Sharswood.</p>

<p>“And shall have the privilege of staying a
few weeks longer.”</p>

<p>Cranny found it hard to refrain from shouting.</p>

<p>“Say, Willie, what does P. G. S. stand for?”
asked Bob, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why, Pretty Good Sort, of course,” laughed
Willie.</p>

<p>“And that’s just what you are!” cried
Cranny Beaumont, “eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>And the others immediately assented with
much enthusiasm and vigor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Sharswood, who had become deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
interested in the development of Border City,
decided to remain in town with his friend,
and make a thorough investigation of the
conditions.</p>

<p>Of course, with the boys, they attended the
greatest aeroplane meet in the history of
Wyoming. The Ogdens captured several
prizes for speed and altitude flights, while
Bob Somers, flying the machine with which
he had become familiar, also made several
records which attracted local attention, and,
incidentally, added to the growing fame of
the Rambler Club.</p>
